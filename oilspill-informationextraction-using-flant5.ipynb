The vessel was old and the oceanic crossing was scheduled to be her final journey.  After delivery of her cargo, the ship was destined for destruction as scrap.  Shortly following departure, a welded seam ruptured between two steel plates on the starboard side, well above the water line.  The U.S. harbor authorities refused permission to return to Los Angeles.  The vessel then proceeded to Ensenada Harbor in Baja California to have the ruptured seam repaired by welding.  Authorities in Ensenada refused permission to have the repair work done within the Harbor so welders were taken aboard and the ship proceeded offshore an estimated 60 miles to have the welding accomplished.  At this distance offshore, the vessel may have been situated within the influence of the southward-flowing California Current System. \\x0b\\x0bWelding repairs were completed successfully.  Unfortunately, a dense fog settled throughout the region.  A single sun sight was made within the two days offshore, to establish the ship's position.  On this basis, a return to Ensenada was undertaken to offload the welders.  In the early morning hours of March 29 1957, the vessel struck the coast at a location about 64 km south of Ensenada Harbor.  The bow grounded against one side of the entrance to a small cove on a predominantly rocky shore.  The stern apparently swung around and stuck on a shallow spot midway across the cove (henceforth Tampico cove) entrance.  The hull thus served as a breakwater across about 2/3 of the cove entrance, creating fairly calm conditions landward of the hull.  The crew and passengers were able to disembark and reach shore safely in the lee of the hull.  \\x0b\\x0bA portion of the oil cargo was liberated at the time of grounding.  The remainder escaped over the next 6-9 months as the ship was slowly torn asunder by pounding surf.   The location was in a remote section of coastline so no countermeasures were taken to remove a portion of the cargo or lessen ensuing pollution of the shore.  A few shacks scattered along the coast here housed native fishermen and their families.  The site was accessible by an extremely rough road, best negotiated by 4-wheel drive vehicles.

The leak started on August 30 when an ammonia line was punctured that was thought to have been not charged. It was originally reported that approximately 500 lbs of the anhydrous ammonia leaked out August 30, however, on September 1 it was discovered that 6000 lbs (this was the full amount on board) of anhydrous ammonia was discharged from the tanks. Approximately 50 lbs of this entered the space it was released in, while the rest drained into the bilge and slowly off gassed. Readings of ammonia in the air were high within the vessel, but were at safe levels outside of the vessel. On scene contractors are following safety precautions. Origninally Sector Puget Sound had requested NOAA's assistance in evaluating response options in terms of atmospheric conditions and plume modeling.

At that time, Sector Baltimore filed an NRC report and dispatched a pollution response team.  DC Fire Dept was already o/s and successfully contained the spill with approx 600ft of harbor boom.  The \"barge\" is actually a permanently moored floating structure/storefront used to sell fish.  The rear section of the structure collapsed, sending two fuel storage tanks into the water, each containing approx 150-200 gals of diesel fuel.  Moderate media interest occurred with local DC radio and the Associated Press contacting the Coast Guard for more information.  CG D5 PADET issued a press release Tuesday afternoon.  No wildlife was reported to be affected.  HEPACO was hired by the responsible party (a private citizen) to clean up the spill.  The spill response continued through Tuesday night, though hampered by darkness and a large amount of oiled debris (wood planks, etc.) in the water from the structure collapse.  DC Dept of the Environment was notified and sent inspectors to the scene.  Clean-up efforts continued through the day on Wednesday; however, late morning on Wednesday, HEPACO expressed concerns about the r/p's ability to pay.  At that point, the USCG assumed federal responsibility for the clean-up efforts and accessed the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for $50,000.  HEPACO was hired was issued an ATP of $30,000.\u000b\u000bJune 6, 2012 UPDATE: Spill response continued through the night last night and continues this morning.  Both fuel tanks have been removed along with 95% of the oiled debris and recoverable product.  USCG anticipates reaching an endpoint sometime later today or tomorrow.

The crew have been reported as rescued and safe. The vessel is a 56 foot wooden fishing vessel. It is said to be carrying 2200 gal. diesel fuel.\u000b\u000bThe vessel sank approximately 43 Miles east of Seward just off Cape Puget in 160 feet of water, at the location 59°55'N--148°27'W. That location is about 1.8 miles south of Cape Puget, in about 180 feet of water.  Coast Guard has requested NOAA to provide possible scenarios and trajectory for possible fuel release from the vessel.   No significant RAR were identified in the vicinity that might be oiled a sudden or slow release of the fuel.   Hence it was decided to not pursue any further actions or remediation, and the case was closed.\u000b\u000bThe seas were reported to be about 2' wind waves, plus swell, at the time of the incident.\u000b\u000bIt is not known if any sheen was observed either yesterday or today.\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nA fishing vessel has sank off the coast of New Zealand.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nDuring mid-morning of 29 June 2011, USCG Sector San Diego contacted the NOAA Hazmat Duty Officer about a 27mile sheen report offshore.  Follow-up information indicated that the report had originated from a Customs & Border Patrol overflight at 0830hrs (Pacific) describing a 27mile by 1,000 foot feature that was “blue-gray” in color starting at 32deg 36.400N, 117deg 57.850W and continuing to 32deg 36.700N, 117deg 25.830W.  A separate vessel report of a fuel smell in the vicinity was provided during the early afternoon.  Sector San Diego requested NOAA trajectory support to direct an overflight at 1700hrs and to get a sense of approximate time and location of landfall, in the event the reported feature persists.  NESDIS also obtained imagery from two satellite passes during the day that appeared consistent with an anomaly in the area. \n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nA sheen report has been issued by the NOAA for the San Diego Bay Area.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nOn June 26, 2011, the NOAA Duty Officer was notified of the sinking of the 68-foot tugboat Aries in the Bering Sea approximately 95 miles east of St. Paul Island.  St Paul is one of the Pribilof Islands, and is about 750 miles west of Anchorage.  All 4 crew members were rescued.  The Tug is sunken in about 300 feet of water, and there is a potential of 29,000 gallons of diesel.  A sheen was reported on the surface. On Monday, June 27, USCG requested a trajectory for the fuel oil believed to be leaking from the vessel.  Rate is unknown at this time. The tug was towing a barge carrying a mobile home and construction equipment. The barge was anchored to keep it from drifting. Another tug is en route and expected to arrive this afternoon. \u000bAt the sunken tug location of approximately 100 nm ESE of St. Paul and about 100 meters water depth, considerable concern was expressed by NMFS regarding the possible oiling of some of the thousands of foraging fur seals which habitat this area, from escaping diesel, even though a very large diesel release as the tug was actually documented by the crewmen from the tug after escaping onto the barge.   \u000b     On several occasions the RP very diligently attempted various modes, both by vessel and by air, to monitoring the occurrence of sheen on the surface nothing was ever noted.   The combination of heavy weather and human safety concerns, led to a halt of these efforts and to the assumption that it was likely that the entire diesel contents of the tug had been relesased.    .    \n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe tugboat Aries was sinking in the Bering Sea.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nAt 1014 hours local time on 8 June 2011, USCG Sector New Orleans notified the NOAA Scientific Support Coordinator of a reported mystery slick WSW of Breton Island.  The size of slick is reported as “several miles” in length.  The initial information is sketchy, and the USCG has launched a helicopter and small boat to investigate as well as coordinating with the USFWS Breton Wildlife Refuge Manager.  No responsible party is yet known.  NOAA was requested to provide an Initial Trajectory Analysis and Resources at Risk analysis.  In 2005, this same refuge was impacted by a small spill resulting in the death of more than 600 pelican.

The F/V Nor’Quest lost anchor on the evening of May 24, 2011 and started to drift ashore towards the Hagemeister Island. The vessel captain notified the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) at 3:15  AM on May 25, 2011. Located within Hagemeister Strait within Bristol Bay and approximately 15 miles S/W of Togiak, Alaska. Lat/Long: 58º44.700N, 160º52.900W. The vessel captain estimates that 16,800 – 18,800 gallons of diesel fuel, 200 gallons of gasoline, 200 gallons of lube oil, 300 gallons of hydraulic oil, and 110 gallons of waste oil are on board the vessel. USCG has conducted an overflight with a C-130 and reported no visible sheen in the area. In addition the USCG contacted the USCG Pacific Strike Team for possible lightering support. The F/V Nor’Quest was unable to remove itself from the grounding location on this morning’s high tide. A second vessel owned by SRW Marine Services attempted to attach a tow line to the vessel but was unable to safely approach close enough. USCG has requested that the vessel operator develop a fuel removal plan and a vessel salvage plan.. Alaska Chadux Corporation, a spill response contractor, has also been notified and has been asked to stand by to assist with any sensitive area protection and spill cleanup if necessary.  Vessel crew is attempting to cap the vessel fuel vents.\u000bOn 29May at 2330 lightering ops commenced, and a total of 9,000 gallons of diesel was lightered off for a total of 12,000 gallons. 15 barrels of misc oils and 200 gallons of gasoline were removed from deck.

This will represent the first opening of the Morganza Floodgates since the 1973 Flood and will move flood waters into flood prone areas west of the river.  Rainfall and spring flooding in the Ohio River Valley has the Mississippi River running very high and this situation is expected to persist for at least two weeks.  Flood gates on the Bonnet Carre Spillway structure in St. Charles Parish Louisiana will be opened starting today (Monday) to release water from the Mississippi River into the Lake Pontchartrain area to reduce the amount of water reaching New Orleans. The USACE will be (or likely has by now) asking the Mississippi River Commission for permission to open the Morganza Spillway structure. Opening the Morganza floodgates will release water into the Atchafalaya River and Atchafalaya Basin or spillway, which includes parts of St. Landry, St. Martin, Iberia and St. Mary parishes in the Acadiana area. Some communities, homes and businesses inside the spillway levees should start preparing now to evacuate if the Morganza is opened is the message being released. The threat is real, and with this threat there is the threat of possible pollution events. \u000b\u000bRRT6 has been activated and is coordinating with the State of Louisiana and the RRT6 Federal Partners as to what threat this may have on facilities that include oil refineries located on the Atchafalaya River and oil production facilities in the basin.

The Princess Kathleen ran aground on Pt Lena just outside Juneau and then sank just off the point with an unknown quantity of Fuel oil in her tanks.  From a time shortly after her sinking to today, she has been leaking fuel oil into the surrounding waters.   Recent increases in the sightings of small oil blobs in the area of Lena Pt. resulted in Sector Juneau's decision to seriously evaluate the wreck for possible removal of the remaining fuel, which is very roughly estimated at 155,000 gallons of bunker C.  On Feb. 16, 2010, Global Offshore Divers of Anchorage mobilized a three-man remote operated vehicle crew to Juneau in response to a request by the USCG, Sector Juneau's Incident management, to survey the wreck of this vessel.   The survey lasted a total of three days from Feb. 17-19 with two ROV's, and the first entry in this Hotline is the Global Diving report from those surveys.    After mobilization of equipment from Seattle, Global Diving tentatively hopes to start pumping oil on or about March 5.  NOAA has been asked to provide weather and trajectory support for this incident. All operations progressed methodically, and hence most of the fuel was successfully removed.\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe SS Princess Kathleen sank in the Juneau area in 1952.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nOn Monday, February 15th USCG Sector LIS received notification from F/V Conor and Michael that the Commercial F/V Perseverance was on fire and the 2 persons on board were transferred to the F/V Conor and Michael.

Fuel was being transferred from a tanker at the adjacent loading dock, when overflow of the tank occurred discharging the diesel into an adjacent oil/water separator.  This unit was also overwhelmed and  the fuel entered Helmet Creek which flows into the small boat harbor portion of Sweeper Cove.  Initially, two areas of hard boom with sorbent boom were placed along the creek and a vac truck was deployed at the oil/water separator.  As of the morning of Jan. 12, it is believed that the vast majority of the diesel was confined to or collected in the stream, and only an estimated 1000 gallons had entered the small boat harbor.   Apparently conditions are fairly calm in Sweeper Cove.   The Coast Guard is planning on chartering a flight out to Adak to ascertain the situation.   Current weather at Adak Island is NW winds at 30 kts, seas 9 feet; however, Sweeper Cove is in the wind shadow on the eastern side of the island. The SOSC requeste that the NOAA SSC join with Bob Petit from ADEC to conduct a SCAT survey of the entire length of Helmet Creek along which most of the oil traveled enroute Sweeper Cove and the small boat harbor.

The barge has 72,000 gallons of gasoline and 72,000 gallons of Jet fuel.  The barge is a 1968 single skin barge.   The grounded barge had gone through two tidal cycles, during which the tug could not pull it off the bottom, prior to notifying CG Sector Anchorage on Sept. 17.    No fuel has been released into the the environment.    The CG requested that the NOAA SSC provide weather and tidal information.  \u000b   Shortly after the grounding a second barge, the OB-5, was summoned from Bethel 80 miles to the north.   Barge OB-5 was able to liter 60,000 gallons of Jet fuel from barge 160-1 and delivered 55,000 gallons to tanks at Quinhagak.   Upon returning to 160-1, barge OB-5 itself grounded just west of the location of the 160-1.   When OB-5 refloated on a subsequent high tide, it was directed to stand by offshore as it had too much draft to conduct further work in the mouth of the Kanektok River.     Crowley summoned another barge from Nome to complete the litering of the still grounded 160-1.  \u000b    The combination of a spring tide and a strong westerly wind produced enough water under the barge to refloat it spontaneously very early on Sept. 22.    The barge was towed to the Quinhagak tank farm where it transferred all its remaining cargo with the exception of 5000 gallons of jet fuel.    It subsequently was directed to Bethel where it will be inspected by the Coast Guard.

These eruptions caused lahars, extensive fllooding, and mud flows around the Drift River Tank Farm, where oil from the Cook Inlet fields is temporarily stored prior to shipping out aboard tankers.    Currently, two of the four active tanks have 74,000 bbls of oil apiece. At 7:30 PM on March 23rd, ADEC and USCG conducted an over-flight to determine any potential threat to the tank farm and related facilities at the Drift River Terminal.  They observed extensive flooding to the area with mud flows to a depth of six feet in the area of the runway and ballast tank, but no significant penetration of the 18 to 20 foot high teritiary containment berm around the tank farm.  No oil or hazardous substance releases have been reported at this time.  Cook Inlet Pipeline Company, operator of the tank farm, is planning on-the-ground evaluation today of the teritiary berms, pumps, and other equipment and facilities necessary for the operation of the tank farm.   The Alaska Volcano Observatory is predicting additional explosive activity of the volcano in the near future, which combined with the extensive amount of snow and ice on the flanks of Redoubt could cause additional significant flooding and mud flows towards the Drift River Tank Farm.    The Coast Guard has asked the NOAA SSC to keep fully abreast of the situation and to participate in conference calls among the CG, the state, the tank farm operator and others.  \u000b       The last  major explosive eruption of Redoubt volcano occurred on April 4.  It was the largest eruption, during this sequence,  and produced the largest lahar to date, completely encircling the Drift River Tank Farm (DRTF).    None of the mud or water, however, penetrated the large dikes around the facility.   As an additional safety precaution, Chevron and Cook Inlet Pipeline decided to completely shut in the  DRTF and proceeded to draw down the oil in the two active storage tanks to minimal levels.    To achieve greater tank stability, 30,000 Bbls of fresh water was added to each of the two active tanks.   \u000b     With no eruptions since April 4 and dome building in the volcano's throat dramatically decreasing, the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) decided to downgrade the threat level of the volcano from orange to yellow on June 29, 2009.\u000b   \n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nRedoubt Volcano resumed its activity on March 22 & 23, with five explosive eruptions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nDuring transfer, a 8000 lb.

The sheening was first observed on October 11, 2007, and is currently only sheening minimally.  Nevertheless, Sector Anchorage has established an IC here in Anchorage to deal with the pollution.   Current plans are to get the PST, along with state and contract folks, to conduct an evaluation and appraisal of the situation probably beginning around the first of next week.   The sheening site is adjacent to a FUDS site in which the Army Corp of Engineers removed 2000 old drums containing only 100+ gallons of mixed petroleum fluids.  In addition to old military drums, the dump site has been used by locals for years and contains derelict fishing gear, batteries, old vehicles, some medical waste and on and on.  As a result, this response is being funded by CERCLA.  NOAA has asked the NWS to provide a weeks' worth of Spot forecasts beginning November 23 and is currently providing tidal data for the incident.   The Coast Guard assessed the situation, Nov. 28, when a six-man team consisting of Coast Guard, state of Alaska, and contractor reps flew to Port Heiden.     Their first impression was how much had changed at the dump site from the photos taken only one month previous.  No sheens or evidence of on-going releases was observed.   Numerous old fuel drums were in the intertidal zone, all seriously rusted and open to the environment.  In one and one-half months time, the shoreline embankment had eroded back from 10 to 40 feet.   As a result, both the FOSC and the SOSC agreed to close the case.  They asked the locals to continue monitoring the beach/dump site, and to remove any old batteries or minor amounts of oily fluids in drums that might appear.

The source, the amount and the product were (and remain) unconfirmed.  However, it is suspected that the release happened sometime on the night of Sunday January 08 and was a diesel or #2 heating oil product (chemical analysis through the  USCG Marine Safety Lab is pending) and the amount is somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 gallons. Helped by slow currents and consistent west to southwest winds, a large portion of the released product pooled at the northern end of the Island End River (IER) and recovery operations have been focused there.  Some oil sheen was reported in the Mystic River (upper end of Boston Harbor) and in the Chelsea River, about a half a mile east of the IER, but none of it was deemed recoverable.  Protective booming of the salt marshes at the end of the Chelsea River (aka: \"Chelsea Creek\") was deployed as an extra safety measure. The Island End River is more of an inlet than a true river.  Historically (a century ago) it flowed through Chelsea and Everett to the sea.  Today it terminate approximately a quarter mile from the Mystic River (generally considered part of Boston Harbor), is about 200 yards wide and heavily industrialized on one side.  The other side has a small park and condominium project known as Admiral Hill.  Environmentally the area is of note due to historic (and heavy) contamination from coal tar.  The bottom sediments as well as much of the southeastern shoreline are contaminated by chronic (now secured) and acute releases of the materials.  The exposed coal tar on the shoreline dates back to the 1940s.  The material is a byproduct of a large coal gasification facility that operated from the turn of the 19th century to sometime in the early 1960s.   Response Activities: The USCG has been supervising the oil spill cleanup contractor as it uses vacuum trucks and sorbents to recover trapped materials.  Over 3,000 gallons (oil) have been recovered thus far.  NOAA Activities: The NOAA SSC has been working with the FOSC and SOSC on cleanup options and spill characterization, including work with the NOAA HAZMAT modeling staff on oil fate calculations, and reverse trajectories.\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe US Coast Guard has notified the Coast Guard of a large oil spill in Boston Harbor.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nOn the night of January 8, 2006, the fishing vessel F/V Infidel sank.

Once refloated, the vessel did not appear completely stable, so the Coast Guard decided to direct the vessel to a nearby facility at the Dania cutoff canal rather than the planned facility further away in the New River.  The vessel made it safely to the facility without incident. No spill or even visible sheening was reported during the entire refloat and movement operation.  The vessel damage will be further assesed and repaired enough to continue to the New River facility or removed from the water by sling at the Dania location.\u000b\u000b\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe Coast Guard has refloated a yacht TV at Port Everglades.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nW and T Pipeline\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe W and T pipeline has been reopened after a fire at a gas station in the city of Houston.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nIt is reported that the tug is on fire, unmanned, and adrift about 8 miles offshore of Barnegat, NJ.

The vessel had 8000 gallons of diesel fuel and 200 gallons of lube oil on board.  The vessel's position at 1400 was reported to be N24 deg 35.1min, W80deg 48.7min, which is 5.7 mi. outside of the FKNMS boundary.  After consultation with Sanctuaries about resource concerns, and NOAA HAZMAT regarding potential drift trajectory, the USCG proposed sinking the vessel before it drifted into Sanctuary waters.\u000b\u000bThat evening at 9:15 pm the vessel sank at position N24deg 47.5min, W80deg 33.6min (approximately 2.2 miles from the FLKNMS boundary) in 370 feet of water.  USCG cutter Drummond had been dousing the smoldering vessel with water to extinguish the fire to allow for the attachment of tow lines so the vessel could be towed further offshore and sunk, but the vessel sank on its own before the towing could be accomplished. At the time of sinking, no report was made of observed oil on the water, however since it was dark, it was difficult to assess.\u000b\u000bAt dawn the next day an overflight reported no sighting of pollution.\u000b\u000bInformation sources: NOAA hotlines and Chief Donald Whittle, CG station Key West.\u000b\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe USCG has notified the Florida Department of Environmental Protection that a fishing vessel caught fire off the Florida Keys.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nDuring early December of 2004, a huge storm drove the floundering M/V Selendang Ayu onto the rockly shoals on the west side of Unalaska Island, where the vessel broke in two releasing over 75%  (337,000 gallons) of its total petroleum fuel products of IFO-380 and marine diesel.   Nearly all the oil was driven onto the mostly rocky shorelines of Makushin and Skan Bays.  Within two weeks the bow section had sunk; however, the stern section remained afloat with the balance of the fuel.    From early January, 2005, until mid-February, 2006, a heavy lift helicopter was used to lighter this fuel from the stern section with over 70 round trips to Dutch Harbor, 25 miles away, and using a 2000 gallon steel sling-loaded cube.   Due to the potential for an additional release during this period, skimmers and dispersants (Corexit 9500) were maintained as standby response measures.   Reasonable weather during these operations allowed for reconnaisance SCAT evaluation and some modest manual shoreline cleanup. 2005 winter operations were halted around mid February due to deteoriating weather conditions.    \u000b    In mid-April, 2005, SCAT and full shoreline cleanup teams returned to Unalaska Island and worked into October, 2005, until again winter weather shut down the operation with only a couple dozen of over one hundred shoreline segments needing further cleaning and/or inspection.   Modest SCAT personnel and shoreline cleanup folks returned in May, 2006, to complete the final shoreline cleanup and inspections.    Manual shoreline cleanup was the dominate technique utilized; however dry mechanical tilling and berm relocation were used quite successfully on the appropriate shorelines. \u000b     One of the key peripheral issues involved possible oiling of the commercial sea food harvest that is caught around and processed on Unalaska Island.  Heightened monitorning and inspections resulted in the finding of no oiled fish products.   Another issue was the oiling and tainting of traditional and subsistence food harvested by the Alaska natives who live on the island.   Task forces of federal, state,  local, and industry representatives were established to deal with these issues.     \u000b     \u000b  \n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe Alaska Coast Guard has completed a comprehensive shoreline cleanup operation in Unalaska Island.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nA lift boat (jack-up barge) collapsed causing a vessel to sink with some diesel and hydraulic oil.

Fearful of capsizing, the captain put out a MAYDAY and\u000ball five crewmen were lifted from the vessel by a Coast Guard\u000bhelicopter.   Northeasterly winds caused the unmanned crabbing to drift\u000bparallel to the coast until the afternoon of Oct. 16 when it was in a\u000bposition 12 to 15 miles due north of Amak Island.  With winds shifting\u000bto the north the Coast Guard became very concerned that it might ground\u000bon Amak Island, the site of a sea lion haulout, classified as an\u000bendangered species.   At this point the Coast Guard asked NOAA to get\u000binvolved and provide a \"most likely\" trajectory for the vessel.   NOAA's\u000btrajectory had the F/V Raven just missing the east side of the island\u000band grounding on the barrier islands outside of Izembek Lagoon, a\u000bNational Wildlife Refuge being very sensitive with its large number of\u000btransient waterfowl waiting to migrate southward.   The CGC Morgenthau\u000bwas on scene shadowing the Raven but was unable to attach a towline due\u000bto the heavy seas.   Instead, it attached a drogue, which slowed the\u000bmovement of the vessel.  Meanwhile the owner hired Dan Magone from\u000bUnalaska to attempt to come to the scene and offer assistance.   Dan\u000barrived when the Raven was only 1 nautical mile off the NE coast of Amak\u000bIsland, and in a dramatic rescue was able to get a line on the vessel\u000bonly 0.3 nm from the island and keep it from grounding.    The Raven was\u000btowed to the lee of the island where it was stabilized, outfitted with a\u000bbetter tow bridle, and then was towed to King Cove to be repaired.   The\u000bcase ended with no pollution entering the water.\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nA crabbing vessel was grounded on an island in the Alaskan peninsula when heavy seascaused it to take on considerable water.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nNOAA HAZMAT contacted at 1230 PDT by MSO Duluth on a 800 gallon spill of\u000bIFO 310 on Lake Superior.

The vessel was anchored in Tanglefoot Bay adjacent the community of\u000bKarluk on the west side of Kodiak Island.   The vessel had 1000 gallons\u000bof diesel and finally came to rest at position N57-34.4, W154-29.4 where\u000ban on-scene observer reported surf crashing through the wheelhouse.\u000bPlanned CG helo overflight for August 21 was canceled due to the helo\u000bmechanical problems.  Instead the CG opened up the Liability Trust Fund\u000band hired a fixed wing Beaver to fly from Kodiak and assess the\u000bsituation, the report from which won't be available until the morning of\u000bAugust 22.   NOAA has provided support with weather and resources at\u000brisk information.  By Thursday night, Aug. 21, the NW winds are expected\u000bto drop to 5-15 kts, and by late Friday the wind should shift around to\u000bthe SW at 10-15 kts.   The grounding site is about one-half mile east of\u000bCape Karluk, the site of a seabird rookery and about one mile west of\u000bthe village of Karluk and the Karluk Lagoon which supports salmon runs\u000bMay through November.   The Lagoon is also the site of sea ducks,\u000boccasional sea otters, and occasional brown bear activity.\u000b\u000bPolRep 2 and final:\u000b Joint Coast Guard/ADEC team flew to Karluk on Thursday afternoon,\u000bAugust 21, and were able to board the F/V Donna Ann.  The wheelhouse had\u000bbeen separated from the hull as a result of the prolonged beating by the\u000bheavy surf and the old wooden hull was in pretty bad shape.  It was\u000bdetermined that all the diesel had been purged from the tanks and been\u000bdispersed in the large and turbulent seas. \n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe Coast Guard is investigating a sinking of a wooden boat in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nOil was released during drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico.  The slick, or sheen, was reported as not recoverable.  Dispersants were considered by the RP. The observed slick is not expected to persist long enough to threaten near shore or shoreline natural recourses.  The source, the bore hole, was initially secured using drilling mud.  An overflight on the morning of 19 August reported only a small amount of residual. \n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nA slick of oil has been observed in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nOn August 19, 2003, it was reported to Coast Guard MSO Valdez that the\u000bskipper of the 54' long F/V Valiant Maid, hit a submerged rock and capsized in 45 feet of water on the NW side of Spike Island just offshore from the town of Cordova in Prince William Sound.   The location of the sunken vessel was N60-33.0, W145-46.3, and it went down with an estimated 500 gallons of diesel in an area of very strong tidal currents.  A long oil slick was noted on the surface, and it was believed that this was just the fuel emanating from the vents and that the two fuel tanks were intact.   Trying to beat some forecast heavy winds for the night of August 19, the owner immediately hired divers to plug the vents.  In so doing the divers noted that the starboard tank was empty of an estimated 200 gallons of diesel.   The next day, when the strong winds never materialized, divers again descended to the vessel to attempt to pump out the port fuel tank, but found it empty also.   Apparently all the fuel  had escaped the first day and been rapidly dispersed by the strong tidal currents, and there was probably less than 500 gallons of diesel on the vessel when in sank.  NOAA provided support to the CG with weather, tidal and resources at risk information.   Several sea otters and seabirds were in the vicinity, but a wildlife observer from the local Eyak native community noted no abnormal behavior.\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe owner of the vessel, a 54' long F/V Valiant Maid, capsized in the Gulf of Mexico on August 19, 2003.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nDuring the afternoon of 18 August 2003, the NOAA Scientific Support\u000bCoordinator was notified by USCG MSU Galveston of a mystery slick off\u000bthe Texas Coast.

Although the\u000bUSCG didn't suggest a possible source, the description of the slick and\u000bthe proximity to the vessel traffic lanes are consistent with a ship\u000btransiting the area and pumping bilge.  The USCG requested trajectory\u000bassistance.  A follow-up overflight, on the evening of 18 August by\u000btraining observers, defined the mystery slick as being a debris line\u000bcomposed primarily of Sargasso weed.  No additional response actions\u000bwere required.\u000b\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe USCG has identified a mystery slick off the Texas coast.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nOn Sunday evening (17 August 2003), the NOAA Scientific Support\u000bCoodinator was notified by USCG MSO New Orleans of a spill near SW Pass\u000bon the Mississippi River in West Bay, Louisiana.  The spill actually\u000boccurred on Saturday, 16 August.  When the USCG investigated the\u000breported release on Sunday, they discovered that the volume reported was\u000bunderestimated and the response effort was slow to contain and recover\u000bthe spilled oil.  USCG personnel on-scene estimated the volume observed\u000b(both contained and trapped in the adjacent marsh) as approximately 25\u000bbbl.

The vessel operator hit a rock, after which he intentionally grounded the vessel at position, 55-53.6N, 155-13.4W.  The grounding resulted in damage to the vessel's bow area, and the fuel tanks were not compromised during the incident.  Nevertheless, it was taking on water.  A Good Samaritan vessel delivered a pump to the F/V Chichagof, but that was unable to keep up with the flooding.   Not until a Coast Guard helo from station Kodiak delivered two additional pumps was the vessel able to control the flooding.  The next morning a welder and marine surveyor were on scene to assess  and repair the damaged bow with a patch over the roughly 1 foot X 1 foot hole.   By Saturday, August 9, the vessel was fully repaired and back fishing.

MEG boomed the\u000bbarge and had two boats standing by on scene.\u000b\u000bMSFO pollution investigator and MSFO marine inspector arrived on scene\u000bat approx 1000 and observed that the barge was intermittently sheening\u000bfrom under the water line at the bow. A Notice of Federal Interest was\u000bissued.\u000b\u000bThe barge had not been involved in any grounding, allisions, or\u000bcollisions since the crew had been on board.\u000b\u000bBouchard hired divers to locate the source of the release.  At 1730 the\u000bdivers reported a hairline crack, approx 6-12\" long, on the bottom of\u000bnumber one starboard tank.  The divers were able to secure the release\u000bby placing an epoxy patch on the crack.  A CG-835 was issued to the\u000bbarge prohibiting the transfer of oil, after discharging at Riverhead,\u000buntil the barge was presented for inspection and repairs were made.\u000b\u000bThe B NO. 160 was giving permission to discharge her product back to the\u000bfacility.  They completed transfer at 1030 on 08JUN03, and the barge\u000bmade way for dry docking and repairs in Staten Island, NY.\u000b\u000bThe pictures taken by inspectors from ACTNY show a 10-12\" hairline crack\u000bthat was located in the #1 starboard cargo tank bottom.  The fracture is\u000bapparently in way of a consistently stressed area of the barge where the\u000bforward rake slopes down to meet the forward tanks.  This causes\u000bfractures in the weld supports and bottom longitudinals.  It is believed\u000bthat this crack is a result of an area that has been affected by heat to\u000brepair these longitudinals numerous times.\u000b\u000bNOAA supplied sensitive area information, trajectory and weather support\u000bto the FOSC.

Upon arriving at the \u000bcommand center at noon the SSC was briefed about the barge explosion and \u000bsubsequent gasoline spill. The barge (what was left of it) and manifold system on the \u000bdock were still on fire. The location of the ExxonMobile facility was: 40deg 31.5 N / 74deg 14.5 \u000bW. Trajectory and weather support were requested ASAP as well as resources at risk. Oil \u000bweathering calculations determined that the gasoline would evaporate very quickly \u000b(about 90% in the first several hours). The two major biological concerns from the \u000benvironmental point of view were rafting waterfowl and potential fish kill. The SSC \u000brecommended that the fire be left burning as long as possible as long as it posed no \u000bfurther hazard to the facility or workers, to minimize the amount of gasoline released onto \u000bthe waterway. The other safety concern expressed was the potential for gasoline to \u000bbecome trapped under piers and docks creating the potential for other explosive \u000bconditions.\u000b\u000bThe two pipelines from the facility to the pier that were ruptured contained about 150,000 \u000bgallons each from the value to the end. One was on fire and the other leaking onto the \u000bfacility.\u000b\u000bAt 1530 the SSC and a MSRC representative went on an overflight of the area on a \u000bUSCG helicopter. The SSC took video footage and digital photographs of the event as \u000bwell as mapping the extent and quantity of oil observed in the Arthur Kill. At the time of \u000bthe flight the tide was ebbing to the south. Oil was noted at the entrance to the Kills, for \u000bthe most part remaining in the center of the waterway. The gasoline was mostly rainbow \u000band gray sheens extending up to the facility. North of the site there were two other \u000bsheens noted, one probably leaching from the landfill site and another mystery sheen. \u000bThe smoke plume was very visible. It wafted up about 125 feet to 300 feet and northward \u000bover Staten Island. The SSC returned to the command post and presented the video and \u000bobservations to the unified command. The gasoline was for the most part non-\u000brecoverable. It was estimated that the amount observed was in the thousands of gallons, \u000bnot tens of thousand or hundreds of thousands. Most of the fuel spilled was consumed in \u000bthe fire or evaporated.\u000b\u000bThe SSC notified Tri-State Bird Rescue of the spill and potential for oiled birds. No birds \u000bwere found to be oiled.\u000b\u000bThe SSC also converted video footage taken by the Vessel Traffic Service into a digital \u000bformat for distribution to the media and investigating agencies.\u000b\u000b22 February 2003 ? \u000bThe SSC was supposed to participate in a first light overflight with the USCG. However, \u000bthe rain and fog prohibited the aircraft from flying. \u000b\u000bAt the 0800 unified command meeting a situation update was given. The manifold was \u000bstill burning and would be attempted to inert and cap that morning. Joint investigations \u000bwere underway by the NYC Fire Department Fire Marshals, Police Department Arson \u000bInvestigations, US Coast Guard, and National Transportation Safety Board. The \u000binvestigators were attempting to map the location of all of the debris. DonJon Marine was \u000bpreparing a salvage plan. The Kills were still under one-way traffic with tug escorts. A \u000bsight safety plan was in place. NOAA was requested to continue weather updated for the \u000bnext couple of days.\u000b\u000bThe SSC participated in a news interview with the Staten Island Advance.\u000b\u000bShoreline assessment teams reported seen sparse sheens off shore. They describe \u000bthem as literally \"evaporating before our eyes.\" Heavy rains and wind were the weather \u000bof the day.\u000b\u000bThe SSC was contacted by the Coney Island Aquarium concerning the possibility of \u000bgasoline entering their water intakes. They were assured that the fuel would not travel \u000bthat far.\u000b\u000bThe SSC converted the video footage from the previous days overflight into a digital \u000bformat for distribution to the media and investigating agencies.\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe NOAA SSC was contacted multiple times around 1100 and requested to report to the USCG Activities New York command center on Staten Island, NY.

The USCG requested the SSC on scene. The Initially, it was \u000bunknown how much home heating oil was lose from the barge. The barge was loaded \u000bwith 56,000 barrels (2,352,000 gallons) and had a draft of 17.9 feet. It struck a \u000brock charted at 18 feet mean low water. Due to the stage of the moon, falling \u000btide, and offshore winds the water depth over the rock was minimal. The tug was \u000bhugging the CT coast to stay in the lee of winds from the NW as it headed to its \u000bdestination in Port Jefferson, NY. The barge was taken to a nearby location (41deg \u000b02.6 N / 73deg 22.053 W) and anchored.\u000b\u000bThe NOAA Scientific Support Team provided the USCG initial trajectory and oil \u000bweathering information, weather, tides, and resources at risk summary.\u000b\u000bAt about 0800 the CT Department of Aquaculture closed the shellfish beds in all \u000bwaters in the Norwalk, Darien, and Westport area until further notice.\u000b\u000bThe divers survey discovered 14 cracks and holes in all six starboard tank \u000bbottoms. The original estimate of cargo loss by the naval architect was 450 \u000bbarrels (18,900 gallons). \u000b\u000bTwo morning overflights (0900 and 1200) by USCG personnel spotted an oil slick \u000bextending several miles from the barge.\u000b \u000bA relief barge arrived along side the holed barge at about 1400. \u000b\u000bAt 1600 the SSC, RP rep and USCG FOSC went on an overflight in a helicopter. A \u000bsheen consisting of light rainbow to silver and gray was observed several miles \u000bfrom the barge. It measured about 3.5 miles long by 200 yards wide at the leading \u000bedge and 600 yards wide at the trailing end. The rest of LI Sound was search and \u000bnot other oil was located. The overflight also mapped locations of ice along the \u000bLI coastline. A new trajectory model was developed based on the GPS positions of \u000bthe slick.\u000b\u000bWith the updated oil trajectory model showing land impacts on the northern Long \u000bIsland coast plans were made to pre-position protective boom as several location \u000bnear identified sensitive areas.\u000b\u000bBy the evening meeting at 1800 the revised estimate of lost oil was downgraded to \u000babout 53 barrels (2,226 gallons). This estimate was within the range of oil \u000bobserved on the afternoon overflight.\u000b\u000bPlans were made to begin over-the-top lightering operation during the first \u000bnight, but due to logistics and operational constraints they were unable to begin \u000buntil later the morning of the 15th. \u000b\u000bOn 2/15 the morning overflight only spotted one small streamer of light silver \u000band gray sheen within the area predicted by the trajectory model. The stern \u000bstarboard quarter of the barge was seen to be awash. No oil was observed near the \u000bbarge or anywhere near the LI coast. Almost all of the oil had evaporated and \u000bnaturally dispersed.\u000b\u000bThe NOAA modelers were requested to provide a ?Worst Case Discharge\" trajectory \u000bfor a possible release from the barge on Saturday evening or Sunday morning. The \u000bnew model indicated potential land impacts on LI more westerly than the oil that \u000bwas initially released.\u000b\u000bBased on the updated weather forecasts for significantly worsening weather, the \u000bUnified Command decided to move the barge into Bridgeport harbor for safe haven \u000bto make temporary repairs and off-load the cargo. At present, as of 1800 this \u000bevening (2/15) the barge is in route to Bridgeport. Travel time is anticipated to \u000bbe about 5 hours at two knots. Contingency plans are prepared for the possibility \u000bof spills while enroute or in Bridgeport harbor.\n\nSummary:\n    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\nThe NOAA has notified the Hazmat duty officer of the grounding of the T/B Energy 5501 barge near Norwalk, CT.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINPUT PROMPT:\n\nSummarize the following incident.\n\nThe SSC was notified of the initial impacts on Tuesday afternoon. It was reported as scattered tarballs along a 10 -- 12 mile stretch of the NJ ocean beaches from Manisquan Inlet to Seaside Heights. The SSC recommended that overflights and SCAT patrols look on the inside of the coastal inlets, as oil might have migrated inside the bay areas on incoming flood tides. Cleanup recommendations and bird recovery and rehabilitation strategies were also discussed. The NOAA Damage Assessment Coordinator was also notified. The NMFS noted that a number of seals (Harbor, harp, hooded, and grey) may be in the area. So far there have been about 20 birds affected (both dead and for rehab). Species include cormorants, ganets, seagulls, and red-throated loons. Manual cleanup operations were underway. With the impending storm cleanup efforts were focused on removal of the gross oil (larger tarballs and patties). Assessments after the storm passes were made to determine the need for further cleanup. There has been no identified source of the oil. The USCG Districts 1 and 5 have passed the word to all units to be on the lookout for any suspect vessels. Samples of the tarballs have been sent to the USCG Oil Identification Lab in Groton, CT for fingerprinting. The SSC brought up the point that the source may also be one of the many sunken tankers off the coast. USCG aircraft expanded their search further offshore in an attempt to spot any subsurface sources. There had been fairly high local media interest both in the New York and Philadelphia areas as well as from local NJ community press. NOAA trajectory modelers investigated the possibility of performing a hindcast to determine where the source of the oil may have likely originated.

The grounded position is 25-40 N; and 80-08W; approximately one mile east of the Cape Florida Lighthouse on Key Biscayne, FL.  Water depth at this location is 3-4 feet.  The vessel has 6,500 gallons of diesel aboard.  One of the vessel's anchors is lost and the other was reported frozen and inoperable.  During the evening, the Coast Guard discovered that sea water and oil had entered the ship's cargo hold, but no sheen was visible in the water near the vessel.  The ship was ballasted to reduce movement and damage overnight.  A weather forecast was provided to the Miami Marine Safety Office that indicated onshore winds through the weekend with a significant velocity increase on Sunday, 10 March.  An initial trajectory analysis indicated that any release of oil would likely move toward shore to the west fairly quickly ; within 2-3 hours.  If all 6500 gallons of oil were released, it would likely create a sheen visible for 2-3 miles which would spread  towards the west.  Shoreline staining from the diesel would not be likely beyond 2 miles from the point of release.  Oiled debris, seagrass and sargasm may need to be cleaned from the beach.  With diesel, localized and short term toxic effects would be of concern.

USCG ACTNY responded to the notification form the vessel. MBTE is a listed hazardous material. Therefore, the response activities were conducted under CERCLA authority and funding.\u000b\u000bIt was estimated that the ship had lost 350 barrels (14,700 gallons), and was leaking at about 9,000 gallons per hour. Due to the flammability of the product, the USCG set up an initial safety zone of one-half mile around the ship. Slowly that was reduced to 200 yards and then 100 yards. Eventually they were able to get Investigators aboard and do damage surveys. The crew began internal transfer of cargo out of the damaged tank.

Most of the released diesel was reported to have been captured by a boom at Metro Machine's floating dry-dock.\u000b\u000bAt 1700 hours NOAA received a call from MSO Hampton Roads about the spill and provided weather, tides, and a trajectory forecast for where the diesel might go if the oil escaped from the boom.  This NOAA forecast suggested that the diesel would move with the Southerly wind and with the tide out of the harbor - maybe as far as Craney Island - and if the release was constant maybe as far as the mouth of the James River by 1 November.\u000b\u000bThis morning the Port of Hampton Roads has very heavy fog and no over flights were conducted.  However, the spill is reported by MSO Hampton Roads to be mostly contained in the boom and cleanup is progressing satisfactorily.

After the barge departed workers at the TOSCO facility discovered oil around their piers. They initiated a clean-up and notified the US Coast Guard Activities New York. The T/B Rhode Island meanwhile went to anchorage off New Haven, CT and Areas had to be cleaned several times as oil continued to wash on shore for several days. Primary clean-up end point was determined to be when all affected areas are unaffected by two tide cycles.  Primary clenup was successfully concluded on the 12th day. No re-oiling on 3 April, and all areas met the two tide cycle criteria. Operations were transferred to a monitor, response and remediation standards to potential reports of re-oiling by either the CG, NYS DEC or the public.  commenced lightering operations. On 23 March, the Marine Safety Office Field Station Coram starts receiving reports of thick, black oil washing up on beaches covering 25 miles on the north shore of Long Island, NY. The Coast Guard response team discovered a four-foot swath of oil at the high tide line at West Meadow Town Beach. Oil was confirmed from Sunken Meadow State Park to Wading River, NY. The Group/Marine Safety Office Long Island Sound (GRU/MSO) identified the T/B Rhode Island had an eight inch by one and one half-inch crack in the hull. The National Response Corporation (NRC) was hired to conduct manual shoreline cleanup. A unified Command was started consisting of the USCG, NY DEC, and Moran.  The weather initially was, winds from the NW at 15-20 knots.  Wednesday, north winds at 10-15 knots are predicted to shift and be from the W-SW at 10-15 knots by the afternoon hours.  Waves:  The seas were forecast to be 1-2 feet.  Precipitation:  No precipitation was predicted.  Ceiling/Visibility:  Clear skies were forecast.  Visibility expected to be unrestricted.  Temperature:  Throughout this forecast, temperatures are expected to range from highs in the 40's to lows in the 20's.  The GRU/MSO obtained samples from the barge and from the beach and had them tested by the Central Oil Identification Laboratory (COIL). The results were a positive match.

Apparently, a storm characterized by the National Weather Service as a Gust Front with 60-70 kt winds, caused the tanker vessel GenMar Hector Maru to surge forward during a transfer operation.  The connection was broken and an estimated 100 bbl of oil was reported released.  At the writing of this initial report, there has been no confirmation of source control.  The location of the spill is Pier 41 in the Texas City Canal (approximately 29? 21.9 N Lat. and 94? 53.6 W Long.)  At risk is a highly sensitive area just south of this location identified as Swan Lake, Lower Galveston Bay, and the Bolivar Roads area.  What is unknown based on the available charts is if a connection between Swan Lake and Texas City Canal exist.  If so, Swan Lake is clearly at risk.  Verbal reports from the USCG suggest that there is no connection.  The spilled oil is reported to be a Kuwait Crude.  Such oils have a relatively light specific gravity, but readily emulsify.

Since the event had just happen, the initial report was sketchy and limited to the location (29? 08.57' N Lat. 094? 40.20' W Long.), vessel name (Bonita), and preliminary situation (explosion - details unknown).  The NOAA SSC contacted the HAZMAT Duty Officer who arranged for \"Home Team\" scientific support.  Given the high probability of loss of diesel fuel and lube oils on board the vessel and the possibility of an uncontrolled well blow-out, the SSC requested that the event be addressed as a potential major release.\u000b\tWeather forecast and trajectory implications were developed by the NOAA HAZMAT Home Team and verbally communicated to the USCG.  Given the forecast on an approaching winter frontal passage and the distance off-shore (25 plus miles), no landfall of oil was forecast for the next several days.  Any diesel fuel released would not persist more than a couple of miles from the release point due to the chemical nature of diesel oil and relative high seas (4-5').  The SSC also consulted with the Texas State SSC relative to trajectory implications.  \u000b\tAt approximately 2100 hrs, the USCG called to update the situation:  The lift boat did explode.  The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.  Six people were injured (broken bones and burns), but at this point, no fatalities.  The sub-sea safety valve was shut preventing any release from the well, and the well was reported to only be producing water at the time of the explosion.  This is still preliminary information, but the USCG was confident that there was no apparent well release based on confirming observations from a USCG vessel on-scene.  The lift boat was damaged, but the fuel tanks were reported to be intact.  Given the updated situation and the low probability of shoreline impacts from any minor release, the NOAA team is standing-down, but remains on stand by.

The spill was the result of heavy rains and a \"weak\" containment dike (this is a simplified characterization of the problem).  One report estimated 35,000 lbs of phosphoric acid diluted into a \"million\" gallons of water was released into a small ditch which eventually emptied into the Houston Ship Channel.  A verbal assessment of the behavior of the chemical and possible risks was provided after contacting Dr. Ed Overton at LSU for his chemistry prospective and a review of the CAMEO data.  \u000b\tWater monitoring had already began using a pH meter.  The verbal results passed to the SSC indicated that the ditch was at pH 2 (bottom of the acid scale).  However, within 40 feet of entering the ship channel, the values were neutral or background.  These may have only been surface readings, so a recommendation was made that a bottom pH profile be taken.  This is because concentrated solutions of phosphoric acid are more dense than water and would initially sink.  Source control had reduced addition drainage from the site to a \"trickle.\"   A fish kill is possible (probable).  A similar release in the same location, but of a much larger volume (45,000,000 gallons), was reported to have caused a major fish kill in 1992.   A cleanup contractor is on-scene and neutralizing the ditch water with lime.  John Kern, NOAA DAC, has been in contact with the state resource managers who are conducting a survey this AM.

The well location was reported at 29 degrees 37' 42.92\" N Lat. and 91 degrees 04' 33.77\" W Long. and adjacent to the ICW.  NOAA was requested to provide weather and plume trajectory support.  \u000b\u000bThe initial report suggested that a well pressure surge had resulted in the well head blow-out preventor structure and secondary distribution valves (a.k.a. the Christmas Tree) being blown off followed by the well \"bridging-over.\"  Bridging-over is a term which refers to sand or other debris filling pore spaces around the well bore in the formation essentially shutting-off or reducing flow.  At first light, no gas was reported escaping from the well and only approximately 2 barrels of oil were observed in the water.  The source was characterized as a 9.5/8 casing which was producing at 15,000 psi.  A one mile safety zone was immediately established and the ICW closed.  The NOAA SSC responded on-scene and briefed the USCG Port Captain on the information provided by the NOAA Scientific Support Team in Seattle, WA (the Home Team).\u000b\u000bAs more information became available, the probable cause of the incident shifted to an explosion of a gas drying system immediately adjacent to the well head.  The explosion knocked off the Christmas tree, but immediately (with 5-10 seconds) the subsurface safety system engaged shutting in the line and preventing further release of gas and oil (the system worked as designed).  Wild well control specialist were brought in to install addition safety valves.  At noon, the well was classified as under control, and the ICW was again opened.

The vessel was fishing illegally.  Upon seizure, the vessel was directed to Dutch Harbor, where it was turned over to NMFS which wanted the refrigeration system, containing 7000 lbs of ammonia, remediated before taking the vessel to Seward.  NOAA HAZMAT become involved when MSD Unalaska contacted the NOAA SSC in Anchorage for advice on whether a water or air release of this ammonia was better.  The vessel is in good mechanical condition, and can sail under its own power.  The systems on the vessel are generally in good working order, a fact that was confirmed when MSD Unalaska transmitted several digital photos of the refrigeration system.  The question of a potential release was put to experts at NOAA HAZMAT in Seattle, as well as to A.J. St. Germain, a member of the CG Pacific Strike Force team with considerable experience dealing with these issues.  After a round-table email discussion among these folks and ammonia experts with the UNOCAL urea plant in Nikiski, serious questions were raised about the possible effects and the need for any release of the ammonia, whether in water or in the air.  In the end, it was determined that the risks of releasing the ammonia were greater than the risks of leaving the ammonia intact aboard the vessel while it was transitted to Seward.  Crew members aboard the Arctic Wind were fully advised of the situation and the need to be on the look-out for any possible ammonia leaks in transit.  The vessel was successfully escorted to Seward with no further problems.

Winds at the time were approximately 10 knots.   All 5 crewmen donned immersion suits and abandoned ship to a life raft, where they were rescued by another fishing vessel.   Upon sinking the vessel immediately began releasing its fuel and oil, which created a sheen from one mile to four mile long over the next couple of days.   The sheen was blown SW out into Shelikof Strait initially until a 40 knot caused it to further disperse and evaporate.   The vessel sank roughly five miles west of Rocky Pt. in about 600 feet of water.   No response was attempted.  USCG district 17.

Initially there was no pollution, as the steel hull of the vessel seemed to hold up against its rough landing surface.  The vessel contained 2000 gals of diesel.  Initial attempt to off load the fuel into barrels was not successful due to heavy weather conditions.  Instead, the vessel was anchored , tied down, and all vents plugged to prevent any further movement of the vessel and possible release of fuel.  By April 22, conditions were calm enough and the tide was higher, that the vessel was refloated and brought back over to the Adak docks, all the while being boomed.  Some minor holes did occur in the hull, and an estimated 80 gallons of diesel were released at the grounding site.  At the Adak docks, divers surveyed the hull and found numerous scrapes, indents, and cracks, all of which would have to be repaired.  USCG district 17.

The barge was carrying a heated cargo of 1,072 tons (2,144,709 pounds) of liquid sodium silicate and approximately 200 gallons of diesel in a deck tank when it sank between 1750 and 1819 hours of 30 January.   The high pH (11.3) and the large quantity of chemical involved posed a potential threat to the fish and invertebrates in the local marine environment.  Ice coverage over the barge ranged from 100% ice on 31 January to 60% ice coverage by 11 February.  The confluence of the Susquehanna and the Elk River appeared to be concentrating the ice along the Maryland Eastern Shore in the vicinity of the sunken barge.  The ice significantly delayed salvage activities due to the dangers associated with diving in heavy ice coupled with the relatively strong (2+ knots) currents observed in the area.  USCG district 5.

The four barges had broken loose from the towboat and three were fully involved in fire.  An unknown amount of gasoline was leaking into the river.  Barges are lashed together and are located at mile 14.5.  Total product onboard the four barges was 70,000 bbl (2,940,000 gallons) of gasoline.  NOAA was asked to provided scientific support relative to possible fate scenarios and resources at risk.  The river was at normal-to-low water levels, and well within its banks.  Therefore, the resources of greatest risk are those in the river itself.  Gasoline is expected to completely evaporate, so the risk to aquatic resources is from acute toxicity from exposure to the highly soluble toxic fractions and near the source.  Transport down river was not expected to be uniform.  Gasoline could collect in eddies and oxbows, and present a potential for downstream localized hazards.  In these collection areas, the gasoline could also absorb to available organic material.  In addition, a local toxic shock to biota in shallow nearby areas was possible.  Pallid sturgeon (a listed endangered species) were present in the river, but were predicted to be concentrate at the control structure (upstream of the release site and not at significant risk).  Other rare species thought present in the river at the time of the incident were paddlefish and blue suckers.  These fish are highly mobile able to avoid exposures that would result in death.  Exceptions might be to juvenile fish in shallow areas close to the shoreline.  The greatest risk was to the commercial fishery.  An estimated 25-30 commercial fishermen worked the stretch threatened.  Commercial fisheries at risk included buffalo, freshwater drum, and several species of catfish.  Other resources present in the area included eagles and wading bird colonies.  For two days the barges were allowed to burn.  When the fire significant subsided, fire suppression experts attached the fire with water and foam.  The barges were then allowed to cool and possible reignition minimized by a foam blanket.  All barges were lightered and moved off scene by the evening of 28 February.  Only a \"negligible amount\" of gasoline was thought lost downstream.

The location of the spill was 60 miles offshore.  The spill resulted when an anchor from a semi-submersible drilling rig dragged across and damaged a 24\" pipeline at both the impact site and at a platform more than a mile away.  Oil was released from both locations.  The water depth was greater than 400 feet.  The initial release volume, based on the amount of oil transferred between the time of the incident and shut in was 1839 bbl.  The line was owned by Equilon Pipeline and identified as part of the Poseidon Pipeline System.  The NOAA SSC relocated to the Shell Command Post at the request of the USCG to support the on-scene incident commander.  Preliminary trajectories suggested that the oil would move west and north.  Landfall was not predicted for several days.  The type of oil was a medium sour crude with an API gravity of 31.5.  Such oils may form persistent tarballs and be transported long distances.  Skimmers were activated.  Given the potential for environmental injury from the spill, dispersants were evaluated and approved under the RRT6 preapproval guidelines by the COTP Morgan City.  The sea state (10-15 knot winds and 4-5 foot seas) was ideal for oil dispersion.  Between 1530 CST and dusk, a total of 3000 gallons were applied (1000 gallons by DC-3 and 2000 gallons by DC-4).  The SMART team from USCG Gulf Strike Team was launched and provided visual monitoring.  Observers clearly observed a dispersant plume and not just surface herding.  It was estimated that 75% of the surface oil had been dispersed.  Dispersant operations ended due to darkness.  During the evening and night, overflights were conducted with both IR and SLAR to maintain contact with the oil.

The cause of the release is still under investigation.  Between 850 and 1200 bbls of a deep well production oil was released.  The oil was identified as MARS Blend, a relatively high sulfur, low asphaltene crude oil.  The initial trajectory predicted the oil would move south of Four Bayous pass and sustained north winds would move most of the oil offshore.  The winds were less than the forecast and the spill coincided with a spring tide (not the season Spring, but the description of the time in the tide cycle characterized by the greatest high and low tides, derived from spring up or rise).  Much of the oil moved back into Four Bayous and Barataria Pass.  The next morning.  Heavy concentrations of oil were observed on shorelines and on water.  The NOAA SSC participated in a morning overflight (pre-SCAT survey) on Thanksgiving morning to delineate oiled shorelines and surface oil.  Heavy surface oil concentrations north of Grand Terre and south of Four Bayous Pass were identified and skimmers repositioned.  Heavy oil was observed on the barrier islands of Barataria Bay.  The barrier islands impacted were Elmer's Island, Grand Isle, Grand Terre, and East Grand Terre.  The latter two were the heaviest impacted and the most remote (no road access).  Stranded oil was heaviest near the passes and on the eastern end of each island.  At least one marina at Grand Isle was impacted.\u000b\tBy Friday (two days after the spill), overflights looked encouraging.  Very little oil was visually observed on the beaches and on-water sheens were significantly reduced; unfortunately, most of the oil was buried by depositional sand and the lower tide level was preventing remobilization of stranded oil.  \u000b\tThe SCAT team used the aerial pre-SCAT survey to aid shoreline assessments since the heavily oiled beach areas were previously identified, but now mostly hidden by over-laying sand.  SCAT was an essential element in the response and used by the Unified Command to define areas which required cleanup as well as monitoring cleanup activities to insure that the cleanup recommendations were both adequate and adhered to by field crews.  More than 100 cleanup works were engaged in this response.  Cleanup objectives and endpoints were developed within the SCAT organization.  SCAT recommendations developed a balance between preserving beach sand (a valued state resource) and minimizing potential environmental threats.  \t\u000b\tAt the end of the day (Sunday, 28 Nov.), only five sites are still being cleaned.  Of particular interest are a small marsh on the interior of East Grand Terre and a Gobi revetment (riprap) along the Conoco facility on the north side of Grand Isle (see Hotline #15 pictures, EGT and GIC, respectively).  Both sites contain free oil.  Both sites present unique cleanup problems.  The interior marsh is highly isolated and composed of very soft sediments which restrict access without causing environmental injury.  Each of the Gobi blocks is an Ïegg crate-like\" structure with spaces which hold trapped fluid oil.

The cause is under investigation by USN, including the Judge Advocate General's office, but it is clear that a valve was left open which overfilled a day tank, fed from a larger storage facility.  Initially, the USN reported to the National Response Center that 1,000 gallons of fuel had been spilled.  Soon after that report, the amount was updated to 20,000 gallons and then to 100,000 gallons.  The official spillage finally was determined to be 112,000 gallons.  The oil flowed from the day tank into an underground drainage pipe, which runs under a runway and several roads for several hundred yards.  The pipe empties into an open drainage ditch, which drains to a 29-acre mangrove forest.  This forest drains through a culvert into Ensenada Honda Bay (a.k.a.: Ensenada Bay).  The USN's primary environmental concern was the bay.

The discharge was estimated to be about 500 gallons.  The product source was from a storm drain, rather than a pipeline, and was traced back to the parking garage of an apartment complex that maintains an oily water separator to treat natural seeps from the La Brea tarpits.  The separator has been inoperable for sometime, thereby allowing the discharge of oily water into the storm drain system that leads out to Ballona Creek.  The source of the leak has been secured and cleanup operations are underway.  So far, about 7 miles of storm drain pipe and about 4 miles of creek are impacted.

The spill was in the bay just offshore the village of Mekoryuk on the north side of Nunivak Island.  The reason for the release was uncertain, however, the USCG was informed that the fuel in the barge was being transferred to other intact tanks.  The USCG also learned that the barge crew had deployed a boom around the spill and were in the process of skimming.  The total amount of fuel onboard was 78,000 gallons  This area is part of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) administered by the USFWS.

The vessel sank in 30 feet of water, 6-8 miles west of the pass entrance.  The vessel was reported to have approximately 7000 gallons of diesel fuel oil and 30 gallons of lube oil onboard.  The amount released was unknown.  Subsequent USCG overflights observed no visible sheens associated with the fishing vessel.  Since no sheens were observed, there was reason to suspect that a majority of the diesel fuel was still on-board.  The USCG considered the sunken vessel a hazard to both navigation and the environment.  While diesel is generally considered a nonpersistant oil with a relatively high evaporation rate and natural dispersion rate, most diesel fuel oils are, at the same time, highly toxic.  The NOAA SSC was asked to provide information to assess potential spill trajectories and possible environmental affects related to the sunken fishing boat.  NOAA also provided an evaluation of potential damages under possible spill scenarios using the Type A Model.  This information was used to develop both a response strategy and a cost-benefit analysis related to salvage operations and cost.  Using the information provided by NOAA, the MSO was able to develop and negotiate a cost effective salvage plan.  The diesel fuel was pumped off the vessel eliminating the environmental hazard.  The evaluation process developed during the F/V LORENTINE III response became a template for future similar responses off the Texas/Louisiana coast.

The freighter Blue Master suffered two gashes 1 and 2 meters above the waterline and along a tank containing IFO 180 (a bunker-type fuel oil).  Oil was in the water.  Initial estimates of the volume released ranged between 50 and 315 barrels (110 barrels was the final estimate).  Given the persistence of heavy fuel oil, the threat to coastal resources, and the potential for shoreline oiling, dispersants were considered.  After an afternoon overflight, more oil was discovered.  Based on this and previous observations it was decided to use dispersants.  At approximately 1830, a DC-4 arrived and sprayed dispersant on the 3-nm by 5-m oil slick.  A total of 700 gallons of Corexit 9500 was applied to the slick.  An overflight August 30 showed a 4-mile long sheen, still 30 miles offshore.  Observation conditions were good light and absolutely calm seas.  No black oil was visible, only sheen.

The spill resulted from the separation of two loading arms on the dock when the T/V ARCO TEXAS stern drifted away from the dock when the mooring broke. The source of the oil was secured automatically when the loading arms broke.   The cause of the incident is under investigation by the Coast Guard.  The oil traveled north parallel with the shore and by 2000 extended as a band of heavy sheen streamers as far north as Birch Point.  Skimmers are on scene attempting to use absorbant mops to pick up the sheen.  Shoreline assessments between Tosco Refinery and White Horn Point noted sheen trapped in eelgrass along several sections of the shoreline near White Horn Point south of Birch Bay, but no direct shoreline impacts. Potential resources at risk include herring spawning areas, surf smelt spawning habitat, birds and sensitive bays and estuaries.

The City of New Orleans, a chemical carrier, was loaded with propane.  The accident holed both the tug and the barge, but neither seriously.  None of the propane tanks on the barge were compromised, but the barge took on water and began to list. After first light, what initially was thought to be a small fuel oil release, appeared much greater.  The tug released an estimated 1200 gallons of fuel oil (the potential spill was estimated at 5000 gallons).  The area threatened by the spill included many very sensitive wildlife resource areas.  Birds were at the greatest risk of impact from this spill because they were present in very large numbers and many of the species present do not avoid oiled areas.  Species present at this time were: brown pelicans (federal, endangered species), a wide range of shorebirds (such as dunlins, sandpipers), wading birds (egrets, avocets, stilts), many species of terns, skimmers, gulls, and cormorants.  The piping plover (state and federal threatened) was also present..  There are two areas of very high bird concentrations: the Bolivar Flats area just north of the North Jetty, and Pelican Island.  Pelican Island is an important nesting area, with up to 11,000 royal terns, 5600 royal terns, and 21,000 laughing gulls nesting there.

They have jurisdiction for fishing violations.  The USCG boarded the vessel and found a decrepit old ship, just an accident waiting to happen.  The fore fish hold was filled with diesel fuel, which although not a violation, was an extremely sloppy maritime practice.  The vessel was rusty, cramped, full of junk, and her systems were just barely in working order.  While in port, a serious ammonia leak occurred driving the crew out of the lower levels.  As a result of this chemical incident the USCG called in the Pacific Strike Team (PST).  The PST sent seven members on-scene and, outfitted in level B protective gear, began monitoring the levels of ammonia in the ship.   In several locations concentrations of several hundred ppm were measured, and since the IDLH for ammonia is 300 ppm, it was deemed a very serious situation. Not knowing how much ammonia was onboard, the PST decided to bleed off the system.  On the fourth level down in the ship, a 55-gallon drum of water and fans were set up to bleed the ammonia into.

After repeated attempts to hail the vessel failed, a Good Samaritan (Sam) vessel volunteered to assist.  The Good Sam vessel arrived on-scene and reported that the Poseidon's nets were in the water, the running lights were energized, the generator was running, but there were no crew members visible on deck.  The Good Sam vessel was thanked for her help and released because the unknown situation could be dangerous. A USCG Station Panama City UTB was launched and directed to investigate the situation.  The UTB arrived on-scene, dispatched a boarding team to the vessel, and discovered three crewmembers lying in the hold apparently deceased.  The boarding team did not go into the hold for safety reasons.  USCG District Eight asked District Seven to transport two gas-free engineers from the Bay County Sheriff's Department to the vessel in their HH-60 from the Air Station (A/S) Clearwater.  The gas-free engineers were lowered to the vessel but were unable to access the hold due to their bulky equipment.  The fishing nets were cut loose and the vessel was towed to Panama City, Florida by the station UTB.  The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), MSD Panama City, Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS), and the local coroner were notified of the incident and met the vessel at the dock.  Once at the dock, the space was certified gas-free and the coroner pronounced the crewmembers deceased. An autopsy was performed.

The initial report was only that a well blow-out had occurred and that the rig was evacuated and on fire.  At least one burn injury was reported.  The production was primarily natural gas and condensate.  Condensate is oil co-produced in a natural gas well and can vary greatly in composition.  In response, NOAA HAZMAT began to develop initial trajectory information should a significant or prolong release of oil occur and continue to gather information related to the type of oil produced.

No release of cargo or fuel bunkers was seen during the initial USCG overflight.  The vessel grounded on the Canadian side of the river, and for the most part, Canadian interests conducted the response efforts.  However, the grounding posed a high risk of contamination that would involve United States' efforts if a spill were to happen.  By day two, the vessel's Oil Spill Response Organization (OSRO) had boomed off the ship and lightering operations were underway. OSRO are many cleanup agencies or companies  that can be contracted by a vessel that has a U.S. port on its itinerary. The names of OSRO's are supplied to the vessel by the USCG to be used voluntarily to secure an agency to perform cleanup operations during the ship's transit in US waters.  The Canadians have a similar program but they are called simply ROs (Response Organizations).  The National Strike Team (NST) Coordination Center reviews each company that wishes to be included on the OSRO list.  They must meet certain criteria to be allowed as a response organization.  Once approved any vessel determines which OSRO will be suitable for their area of transit and what they are carrying.  Or they may contract an organization elsewhere to suit their's and the USCG's needs.  On day three the vessel was successfully pulled off and anchored for a hull inspection by divers.  There was no major damage to the vessel's integrity so she was allowed to steam to a dry dock facility for repairs.

On-scene conditions were 55-knot winds, 30-foot seas, snow, icing conditions, and 1/4 nm visibility.  The quantity of logs was quite large-200 to 400 log bundles of 80 to 100 logs per bundle.  The logs were 41 to 45 feet long and 4 to 15 inches in diameter; each bundle weighed approximate 27 tons.  The USCG deemed these logs a hazard to navigation of TAPS tankers, container vessels, and maritime traffic in the GOA.  Initially the logs were in MSO Juneau's zone and, along with the Seventeenth District Coast Guard Operations Center in Juneau, requested that NOAA provide weather forecasts and predict trajectories of the logs to monitor the position of the logs help their C-130 overflights.  NOAA's initial report to the USCG was that the trajectory of the logs will continue west-southwest at 2% of the wind speed (0.5 knots) until they cross the 100-fathom curve where they will encounter the Alaska Current and begin moving in a west-northwest direction at approximately the same speed.\u000bDue to the severe weather, many of the log bundles broke apart making it very difficult for ships' radar to see this debris.  The weather was not cooperative and overflights could be conducted only every 3 to 5 days.  As location reports came in, they were forwarded to NOAA in Seattle who then used this information to provide a search location for the next overflight.  The Alaska Stream occupies this portion of the GOA and moves from east to west and the logs were gradually dispersed and carried west-northwest toward the central GOA.  As the logs moved west, MSO Valdez became involved in the tracking effort and served to coordinate information flowing to and from USCG Kodiak Air Station who was conducting the overflights.

Phone calls soon began to filter into the local fire station describing a strong diesel smell within a cluster of homes at Scottish Pike in South Knoxville, Tennessee.   When a fire truck arrived on-scene, a fountain of diesel fuel was spewing heavily onto an adjacent house and an immediate evacuation of six homes took place.   At the same time notification to shut down its pipeline was given to Colonial Pipeline (RP).  They were also told to boom off Goose Creek, at the junction of the creek and the Lake.  The diesel had flowed down an embankment to Goose Creek then into the lake and river creating a slick 60 feet wide  and several miles long.  The USCG was notified and dispatched a team from MSD Nashville and three members of the USCG GST.  EPA arrived on-scene the morning of February 13 and assumed the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) position since the spill originated from shore.  The cause of the spill will be investigated by the National Transit Safety Board (NTSB).  The spill occurred at river mile (RM) 647.5, which is below the City of Knoxville's  water intakes.  Additionally the river is controlled by a dam ( Fort Loudoun Lake Dam) that shut down operations soon after notification of the spill.  By midmorning the RP and contracted response organizations had boomed off three locations down river.  Because it was dyed red the diesel produced a very noticeable slick. The current in the area was flowing at 1 knot and a little faster in the river bend just a couple of miles downstream from Goose Creek in the area called Sequoyah Hills.  From there the river opens up wider and the current drops off significantly.   As the diesel spread out, rainbow sheens developed.  This was prevalent between Sequoyah Hills and a mile down river to Looney Island.  As the spilled diesel weathered, silver sheens became more prevalent after day two and even more on day three.  Additionally silver steaks could be seen from the air  leeching off a point at RM 645.  South of Looney Island to Sequoyah Park the diesel was observed to be in streaks and patches.  On shore the diesel penetrated deep into the riprap shorelines and maybe an inch into the fine-grain sand shores from Goose Creek to Sequoyah Hills.  Oil film and a brown frothy mousse could be seen downstream of Sequoyah Hills. Additional shoreline impacts were at the booming site at Sequoyah Park where unweathered diesel pooled at the junction of the boom and shoreline.  Some oiled debris was located at RM 639 near Maxey's Boat Dock.  Fortunately half the area is guarded by bedrock bluffs resulting in less shoreline impact and probably accounted for a high percentage of recovery noted by the RP.  Officially, 45,000 gallons of diesel was released and 90% was recovered by skimmers and vacuum trucks.  The initial report of the spill indicated that there had been 80,000 gallons of diesel released.  In which case the mass balance breaks down to 50% recovered, 30% evaporated, 15% Goose Creek soils, and 5% other shoreline impacts.  USCG district 8.

The spilled oil is a light crude oil with an API of 28.7 degrees.  A 3 mile by 0.25 mile slick has been reported.  A Falcon overflight from Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas has been requested.  Dispersants are being considered should the volume released be considered a significant nearshore and shoreline threat.   The rig is located approximately 70 miles offshore.  Preliminary assessment suggest that if the estimated volume released remains low (less than 100 bbl), environmental risk is low.  NOAA HAZMAT will develop a detailed trajectory and transport/fate analysis when information from the overflight is received.

The spilled oil was a condensate crude with an API of 38.  The stretch of shoreline from Galveston to Freeport is historically an area with high concentrations of birds.  In particular, the area around San Luis Pass is an important feeding and loafing area for shorebirds, gulls, terns, loons, pelicans, and wading birds.  At the time of the spill, because of the very early spring weather, many birds were staging along the beaches, particularly shorebirds who are feeding to bulk up for the migration to nesting areas.  Though shorebirds have a lower tendency to get oiled (compared to diving birds who spend much of their time on the water surface or diving for prey) they spend a lot of time feeding at the water/land interface where any tarballs that come ashore are likely to concentrate.  With onshore winds, the ultimate fate of any persistent oil was shoreline stranding.  Normally, tarballs on shore are not an issue because they are easy to clean up.  However, because of the high concentrations of birds present in the area of the predicted impact, there was a risk of birds getting oiled.  USCG district 8.

Heavy surf and high winds throughout the next several days made boarding the vessel difficult and dangerous. While the preferred option was to salvage the vessel with the oil on board, the Unified Command requested that contingency plans for vessel lightering, cleanup and pollution response be developed. The longer the ship remained grounded, the greater the risk of it leaking its load of nearly 400,000 gallons of fuel oil. Moreover, a small group of endangered snowy plover was located approximately 800 yards south of the vessel.  In fact, on February 8, shipboard personnel observed oil burping out alongside the ship from a small crack in the hull and on the beach near the ship.  On February 9, a tug tried to pull the ship off the beach. But by then winds and waves had driven the New Carissa approximately 600 feet further shoreward, beyond the operational reach of the salvage vessel and its ability to safely anchor near the surf zone. The bow section was towed and sunk on March 11, 1999 in 1,811 fathoms of water 282 nautical miles off the Oregon coast.  58 Federal, state, county, and local agencies took part in the month-long response.

Several train cars entered the water but only one breached its contents of titanium dioxide into the environment.  Three other cars containing hazardous materials with a high degree of release potential were precariously mingled in wreckage. Of these three cars, two  contained sulfuric acid and the other one contained a mixture of pentane and isoprene.  Each car's capacity was 10,000 gallons.  At the time of the derailment, it was not clear what was in the water and several water intakes were closed until further investigation was conducted. Weather at the scene was calling for northwest winds of 15 to 20  knots, temperatures in the low 20s and a chance of snow.  The following morning there was an inventory taken and assessment made to verify that there was only titanium dioxide in the water.  The intakes were reopened and monitored throughout the operation.  The higher concerns were to stabilize the cars of sulfuric acid, pentane, and isoprene and to remove them from the area.  The railroad company quickly brought in heavy machinery to clear the wreckage.  A full crew worked around the clock in laying approximately 1 mile of new track.  Entry to the site was through private property where the RP negotiated a fair economic settlement  with the owner for access and staging equipment.  By day two, a salvage plan was submitted for those railroad cars in the water.

The location of the spill was given as 28? 43.5' N by 93? 36.5' W.  This is about 60 miles offshore of Sabine Pass and within a mile of the dividing line between two USCG response zones.  The vessels location is in MSD Lake Charles's Response Zone, but the oil quickly moved into MSU Galveston's Response Zone.  MSU Galveston requested an oil trajectory on 24 Nov. (see Hotline #2) and stated that overflights would be conducted by MSD Lake Charles.  The NOAA trajectory doesn't anticipate any landfall within the next three days (the duration of the trajectory forecast).  In general, given the type of oil, quantity spilled, and current offshore weather and ocean currents, the potential for observable beach oiling is very low.  Nearly half of the oil will evaporate and the rest will form small tarballs.  The later are very persistent and may travel many hundreds of miles, but will probably be so highly spatially dispersed that they will be virtually undetected.  They will be lost among the background tarball population of the Gulf of Mexico.  Tarballs in the Gulf of Mexico are derived from both natural seeps and anthropogenic spills.    NOAA SSC (Henry) will follow up and update the situation when more information is available.

The report was that four slicks of thick light brown oil extended for a distance of ten miles north of the above position.  The northern end of the slick was a \"diesel like\" sheen.\u000b\u000bThe SSC consulted with Jerry Galt and Glen Watabayashi of NOAA HAZMAT in Seattle and provided the Coast Guard with a verbal trajectory.  Seattle HAZMAT used the Texas General Land Office's (TGLO) TABS buoy system current information as well as current and forecasted weather information to evaluate the situation.  It was determined that the slick would most likely move to the WNW of the reported position at approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of a knot.  The reported position was as of 1730 on Saturday afternoon and due to logistical constraints the MSU was unable to schedule an overflight until Sunday afternoon.  In this interim the slick could be expected to move 10 miles to the WNW.\u000b\u000bOn Sunday afternoon the Coast Guard conducted an overflight and with the trajectory information provided, they were able to successfully locate the slick.  The overflight revealed a 200 x 200 yard slick of light brown oil which was somewhat patchy.  It is believed that either the initial report overestimated the amount of product or the majority had already evaporated.  Due to the distance offshore (100 miles) and the small amount of product no further response was warranted.

Approximately 26 containers from the first tier (hatch) and 4 containers from the second hatch were lost overboard and into the Gulf of Mexico, they have not yet been located.  The damaged tiers of containers do hold some hazardous materials and some may have been lost over the side.  The nature of the hazardous materials are mostly flammable liquids and acids.  No oxidizers, poisons, or explosive substances have been identified.\u000b\u000bOverflights were conducted by a Falcon Jet out of ATC Mobile and by MSO personnel aborad a HH-65 from air station New Orleans.\u000b\u000bAn initial planning meeting was held at 1500 at the New Orleans MSO, in attendance were; USCG, NOAA, Louisiana State Police-Hazmat, NOFD-Hazmat, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, salvage representatives, response contractors, cargo owner and the tug operator's representative.  At this initial meeting all known hazards were identified, all parties concerns were addressed and initial objectives were set.\u000b\u000bCurrently the tug and barge are en-route to the mouth of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO).  The MRGO is a channel which bypasses the Mississippi River and leads to the industrial canal of New Orleans.  The tug will be met by a USCG 41' patrol boat.  On board are members of the MSO and Gulf Strike Team.  They will conduct a visual inspection of the vessel and cargo stability and conduct basic air monitoring.  They will not be boarding the tug or barge.  Upon completion of this inspection a second planning meeting will be held later this evening (est. 1830).  At this time it is believed that the barge will be allowed to transit up the MRGO to the Sea-Land terminal in the industrial canal.  Once the barge is alongside more extensive air monitoring and initial space entries and assessments can be made.  Once a detailed assessment is made the containers can be safely removed.\u000b\u000bNOAA has provided chemical characterization, CAMEO runs and interpretation, hazards assessment and weather support to this incident.\u000b\u000bAttached are two photos of the barge and damaged containers taken by MSO New Orleans on 4/27.

PHONE (206) 526-6317. - _ - Per your request we have looked at trajectory implications of the urea that has been released from the barge Alaska.  These notes are based on the following information:-  - A barge located at 56? 28'N, 132? 23'W (Wrangell, Alaska) is reported to have cracks in the starboard and portside.  The vessel is carrying an unknown amount of urea stored as a bulk product.  At this time, the vessel is not leaking product.-  - If any of this initial information is incorrect, please let us know ASAP as it would affect any trajectory implications. - _ - 1) WEATHER - Today, the winds are forecast from the south at 30 knots with rain.  Tomorrow, the rain is expected to continue with winds from the south at 25 knots. -  - 2) GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF UREA - Urea is a white crystal or powder with very faint odor. It has a density of 1.3 (it would sink in water) and is soluble in water. Urea is commonly present in nature, in urine and other body fluid. As a fertilizer, urea contains 45-46% nitrogen, and is usually in the form of small pellets or granules. It is shipped in bags or in bulk.  -  - 3) TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS - The harbor is generally shallow and is rapidly flushed due to tidal action.  Any dissolved product will be quickly diluted by water exchange through the harbor entrance.  The dissolved urea will not affect the pH of the water much, the effect, if there is any, will be localized, and given the tidal current present any effect will quickly dissipated because of the flushing effect in the harbor. -  - 4)FATE AND EFFECT OF UREA - Solubility - Urea is very soluble in water.  In the case of a capsized vessel, the urea pellets will sink to the ocean floor while  dissolving in the water column. Water currents facilitate the dissolution process of urea in the same way that stirring a cup of coffee helps dissolve the sugar faster. Since the urea was stored in bulk, the granules may disperse as a \"cloud\" of fertilizer, each granule sinking independently while coming in full contact with the water. - Effect on pH - When urea dissolves in water it forms a weak base. The pH of the ocean water varies between 6.5 to 8.5. Usually it tends to be somewhat basic. In addition, the ocean has a substantial buffering capacity. In the past even large urea spills had minimal effect on the pH and we would expect the similar process during this incident. - Effect on the environment - We would not expect to see any algae bloom or other nutrient driven changes. The spilled urea dissolves quickly, eventually turning into carbon dioxide which escapes as gas and dissipates, and ammonia, which dilutes in the prevailing tidal current and quickly drops to ambient concentration. It is quite possible that the concentration of available nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) may be elevated for a short period of time at the immediate location of the spill. However, considering the rapid dilution and dispersion into the water column, exposure to organisms is predicted to be short-term. The biological literature focuses on phytoplankton effects and these seem to be mediated by light.  At this time of the year, the phytoplankton population is relatively small, and the amount of daylight minimal.  Adverse effects are expected to be minimal and confined to the harbor.

In addition, it was agreed that any attempt at protection strategies would prove pointless, given the heavy surf.  The FOSC considered sending divers to close the vents.  It was agreed that, if the vessel was in 200+ feet of water, such an operation would be unnecessarily risky to the divers. -  - On the morning (11/3/97) overflight, no sheen was sighted.  The vessel's owner had determined the depth of the vessel at 140 feet and had decided to send hard-hat divers to begin salvage operations.While the divers are on-station, they will close the vents to prevent any further release.  The diving operation will begin Tuesday (11/4/97), weather permitting.  USCG will monitor for oil releases at that time. -  - The vessel sank less than one mile north of the Stellwagon Bank National Marine Sanctuary and some twelve miles east of the Plum Island USFWS Reserve.

Reports were received from two rigs on the High Island lease block.  One report came from High Island 177 (position 29?11.0 N, 094?23.0 W) and the other from High Island 195 (position 29?10.34 N, 094?22.18 W).  The reported slick was estimated to be two miles wide by ten miles long consisting of a \"thick sheen\" or \"rainbow colored sheen and some dark areas\" depending upon the reporting party.  On-scene weather was winds from the SSW at 10-15 kts., seas of 4-6 feet, visibility of 5 miles and temperatures in the 70's. -  - MSU Galveston requested initial trajectory analysis and resources at risk from the Assistant SSC while simultaneously launching a helicopter overflight to confirm the sightings.-  - The initial assessment was that the slick was not an immediate threat to the coast and the present rough on-scene weather would facilitate dispersion of the slick, and that the passage of a front (expected in the following 12 hours) would cause the wind to shift around to the NNE, away from land further decreasing the threat.  The helicopter overflight revealed a two mile long slick of rapidly dissipating sheen.  Pending further developments the case was closed.

The tank flooded, causing the barge to roll upside down, releasing most of her 12,500 tons of bulk granular urea six miles west of Ninilchik, Alaska in Lower Cook Inlet at a water depth of approximately 120 feet.  The COTP ordered the barge towed upside down into Kachema Bay for salvage.  Once there,  high winds forced the vessel to circle around before finally being anchored and boomed off just off the end of Homer spit.  Of equal concern were fuel tanks with 1,000 gallons of diesel and roughly 250 gallons of other general oils.   No sheen was noticed and these tanks appeared intact.   Diver inspection of the overturned hull reported that all doors and hatches were closed and sealed, except for a port aft cargo door that was buckled in about two feet leaving a one-foot opening to the cargo hold.

The pilot prepared for passage through the \"Million Dollar Bridge,\" an extremely narrow draw bridge, affording less than five feet of clearance on either side of the vessel's mid-section.  Accounting for a rising tide and southwesterly winds, the pilot approached the opening from the northern portion of the Fore River and misspoke the helm command.  By the time the order could be corrected, less than a minute later, the vessel was committed and allision (a moving object hitting a stationary one) imminent.\u000b\u000bThe Julie N struck the southern side of the bridge,  a sharp buttress damaged her just below the waterline  The exposed part of the bridge opened a 15-foot hole into the forward port bunker tank, the forward void space, and the number one port cargo tank.  The gash in the cargo tank was small by comparison to that of the bunker tank,  less than a foot wide and approximately three feet  high.  The bunker tanks were carrying intermediate fuel oil (IFO) 380.\u000b\u000bThe vessel reported the allision immediately to the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and asked permission to proceed to the Sprague Terminal, some 1,000 yards downriver.  Permission was granted.  The Julie N headed for the terminal, leaking oil as she went.  The local oil spill cooperative, Clean Casco Bay, Inc., was notified as were state and federal authorities.  As the ship was tying up to the Sprague pier, state and spill cooperative personnel were deploying a variety of booms around the injured vessel.  During that time, USCG personnel on-scene, estimated that the vessel was leaking at a rate of 500 to 700 gallons per minute.

The tug Scandia was located some three miles south and west of Point Judith, Rhode Island towing the barge North Cape, which was carrying 94,000 barrels of #2 home heating fuel  Weather was severe with sustained winds of more than 40 knots from the south-southeast and forecast to increase.  The tug Scandia was abandoned and USCG Search and Rescue teams were dispatched to assist the crew.  At approximately 2000 EST, a USCG helicopter reported that the barge North Cape was aground on Nebraska Shoals, directly adjacent to the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge, owned and operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).  The helicopter further reported that the barge was releasing oil.  The barge North Cape spilled oil in two separate releases.  The first, released during the height of the initial storm, was 700,000 gallons and the second, less than a day later, was 125,000 gallons.  The combination of the type of oil released and the energy of the storm caused great dispersion into the water column.  As a result, in the days following the spill, great numbers of shellfish (mostly bivalves and juvenile lobsters) washed  ashore.  Subsequently, the Rhode Island Department of Health closed more than 200 square miles of commercial fishery in the area of the spill.  This closure was coordinated with the EPA Region One and with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which closed federal fishing grounds using the Magnuson Act.  This is the first time federal fisheries have been closed due to oil contamination.  The emergency phase of the response lasted seven days and the on-scene command post was demobilized following the removal of the barge North Cape from the beach.  Active USCG spill response and assessment continued from the MSO, including re-survey of key impacted recreational and endangered piping plover nesting beaches.  The full re-opening of the Rhode Island fishery was not complete until the middle of June.

It is possible that the release was gradual over the course of weeks or months until the material released reached a level that caused a visible reaction in the waters of the barge canal.  The spill site is actually two water bodies; an industrial barge canal in Bienville Industrial Park and a freshwater riverine/marsh habitat in the adjacent Mulatto Bayou.  Mulatto Bayou runs somewhat parallel to the barge canal with several bank cuts allowing water interchange between the two.\u000b\u000bHopper barges RL-224 and RL-229 had been alongside the industrial park at the dead end of the barge canal for several weeks and several months, respectively.  Their cargo of dry ferrous sulfate was destined for Eaglebrook Inc. but was rejected because it was out of specification for their needs.  Ferrous sulfate is reacted in a controlled situation by Eaglebrook to make a flocculating agent used in wastewater treatment.  As the barges waited at the industrial park pending final disposition, it is believed that water entered the barges through holes in their wing tanks and then, through free communication with the hoppers themselves, made contact with the cargo.  During the response the contaminated water in the hoppers was found to have a pH of approximately 2.0.  The contaminated water in the wing tanks was found to have a pH of approximately 3.0.  This water, carrying unreacted product, is thought to have escaped the barge and entered the barge canal.  USCG district 8.

The vessel was moored at the Coastal Transport dock on the ship canal in Ballard, a suburb of Seattle, Washington.  At the time of the fire, 70,000 gallons of #2 fuel oil in the double-bottom fuel tanks, one 3,000 pound tank of anhydrous ammonia, various cans of paint products, and eight 150-pound cylinders of chlorine were onboard.  An unknown amount of chlorine was released during the fire and 15 firefighters suffered respiratory distress and minor skin irritation.  The USCG MSO dispatched a USCG Fire Fighting Coordinator, HAZMAT team, and a 41-foot patrol boat to assist the Seattle Fire Department Incident Commander.\u000bThe fire started in the forward part of the processing area of the vessel when a welding spark fell on combustible material.  The fire spread to the lower deck and forward to the forecastle, causing extensive damage to the factory processing area.  Smoke from the fire necessitated closing the Ballard Bridge to traffic.  The main fire was extinguished at 1130, but the vessel contained hot spots and continued to have small flare ups through the night and into the next day.  Chlorine levels continued to be detected on the vessel and on the dock alongside, but, due to the threat of re-flash, the Seattle Fire Department suspended efforts to mitigate the potential chlorine release until November 10.  A USCG HAZMAT team member remained on-scene with the Seattle Fire Department overnight fire watch.  A unified command was set up among the USCG, State of Washington, vessel owner, and the Seattle Fire Department to address the continuing threat of a chlorine and/or ammonia release from the vessel.  The unified command met several times November 9 and 10 to review plans for site safety, the proposed repair and removal of the chlorine cylinders, ventilation of lower compartments, and vessel salvage.  \u000bThe chlorine threat was mitigated, the fire completely extinguished, and the vessel declared safe for entry by the morning of November 10.

The San Jacinto River rose from its normal height of 2.5 feet to 24.3 feet.  The river overtopped its banks, cutoff a meandering loop, and scoured a new channel through a normally dry area containing pipelines.  As a result of the flooding, Houston had been declared a National Disaster Area and the estuarine environments of Galveston Bay were stressed because of the influx of fresh floodwaters.   As the flood waters began to recede, pipelines began to rupture.\u000bIt was surmised that large debris or some barges had broken free and were caught in the high-river currents and collided with the pipelines, causing four of them to rupture.  It is also possible that the new channel cut by the flooded river may have undercut the pipeline supports, which were not designed for water crossing.   \u000b\u000bThe ruptured pipelines contained gasoline, crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas.  Within hours of the ruptures, the spilled products ignited and, already caught up in the flood waters, become a burning mass moving downstream.  The fires destroyed many homes along the river banks.  However, as a result of the fire much of the spilled products were consumed.  After some time, the fire continued only at the source of the leaks.  The natural gas leak stopped, but a combination of the remaining products continued to leak.  USCG district 8.

The vessel was approximately 10 miles west of Cape Sarichef on the western side of Unimak Island and riding in relatively calm seas.  At the time of the fire, the vessel was carrying 126,000 gallons of diesel fuel, 7 bottles of acetylene, 12 bottles of oxygen, 10,000 gallons of lube oil, 8 drums of hydraulic oil, 2 drums of gasoline, and 38,000 pounds of ammonia.  After the initial diesel release on July 24, additional oil pollution was considered a low probability as the integrity of the fuel tanks and hull were not threatened by the fire.\u000bThe USCG responded to what was initially a search and rescue mission.  They safely rescued all but one crewmember who, unfortunately, was killed while fighting the fire.  The fire caused the failure of a 10,000-gallon diesel day tank on the fore deck and the explosion, release, and fire of most of the 38,000 pounds of ammonia.  The diesel release resulted in a reported 8-mile long sheen that dissipated within 12 hours.\u000bTo move the vessel from the sensitive resources in Unimak Pass, a bridle was fitted to the stern of the All Alaskan and she was slowly towed westward to deeper water in case scuttling became necessary.  The fire subsided by Monday, July 25 but continued smoldering in the fore peak holds of the vessel.  Three USCG cutters and several members of the Pacific Strike Team went to the scene to assist.\u000bOn July 26 the vessel was brought into Captain's Bay at Dutch Harbor where the fire was completely extinguished and the vessel was thoroughly evaluated.  One bottle of ammonia was found slowly leaking after the vessel reached port; the rest were believed lost while the vessel was burning at sea.

The barge was in tow from Toledo, Ohio to Cleveland, Ohio carrying 1,013,325 gallons of No. 6 Fuel Oil.  In 1961, the Army Corps of Engineers supervised a salvage operation to raise the barge from its original location, move it clear of the shipping lanes, and resink it in 70 feet of water.  Records showed that the barge, currently resting keel up,  could still contain up to 800,000 gallons of product in 5 of its 6 tanks.  The COTP federalized the incident after divers observed an ounce of oil leaking out of a 1.5 inch valve every 13 minutes.  This leak was plugged on 16 July and an inspection of all exposed valves on the hull was conducted.

The well is located in a dead end slip 400 yards south of the intracoastal, see initial report.  During initial attempts to control the well, uncontrolled downhole pressure release was experienced (a kick). The slip was boomed and it was estimated 10 barrels of distillate were in the slip, none in the Intracoastal Waterway. The evening of July 8 a new plan was submitted to control the well which included moving in a fire prevention barge.  July 9 preparations for the well capping were proceeding.  Three firefighting barges were being moved into place.  Well control experts approached the well and sprayed a fog of foam and water for 10 minutes to reduce the treat of explosion prior to a plugging attempt.

The diluent, which is a mid-grade condensate product, had been injected into the production wells throughout recent decades to increase the yield from the oilfield.  For economic reasons, the practice of injecting diluent into the wells replaced the use of steam during the 1950s.  UNOCAL stopped injecting diluent by 1990.  Either through poor injection practices or through a faulty pipeline system, diluent was released into the field in large quantities.  Current estimates are that there may be as much as 8.5 million gallons of diluent located in various plumes throughout the 2,300 acre site.

The 202-foot Cynthia M, with a capacity of 340,000 gallons, was loaded with 310,000 gallons of a 30 percent solution of caustic soda.  Her list was suspected to have been caused by open valves that allowed free communication of liquids between internal tanks.  The weather onscene was winds from the southwest at 15 to 20 knots.  The tidal excursions for the Hackensack River were estimated to be between three-quarters of a mile and one mile.\u000bThe port side of the barge was completely submerged from center line to rail, resting solidly on the bottom.  The USCG, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, and New Jersey Marine Police went to the scene and assessed the situation.  Initially, the capsizing of the vessel and its subsequent loss of cargo were the greatest concerns.  On March 16 it was estimated that approximately 150,000 gallons of cargo had been lost into the Hackensack River and Newark Bay.  The caustic soda escaped from a vent on deck that had submerged because of the vessel's list.  At 1235 water testing of pH near the barge showed readings of 12; by 1535 the readings were 9, indicating that pH was returning to normal levels.\u000bThe responsible party hired a marine salver to raise the barge, and state and federal agencies monitored the water pH until it returned to normal.\u000bThe USCG was onscene about two weeks monitoring the spill response and salvage.

The power plant is approximately two miles downriver of the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit.  The leak was continuous and occurred from approximately 2230 on February 9 to 0330 on February 10 and was described as flowing at the rate of a fire-hose discharge.  Oil had broken through a corroded portion of a 10-inch supply line, ran into a storm sewer, and then traveled about 100 feet to enter the river.  When the incident occurred, the Detroit River was 95 percent ice-covered.\u000bOriginally the released product was thought to be a #6 oil, but laboratory analysis proved it was a #4 fuel with density of 0.93.  The original estimate of 10,000 to 30,000 gallons proved a conundrum as only about 300 gallons was observed in the river.  Later volume refinements had the number at officially  less than 900 gallons and most likely around 300 gallons.  The City of Detroit assumed responsibility for the spill and immediately hired Marine Pollution Control.  Only a limited response was possible due to the ice.  A portion of the spilled oiled was recovered by removing the oil-stained ice accessible from the shorelines.  The Detroit City Laboratory performed the first analysis on the oil, determining that it was a #4 rather than a #6, and that it was a \"floater\".  The City immediately hired Tri-State Bird Rescue to assess the threat to nearly 5000 birds in the oiled area and to establish a rehabilitation center, if necessary.\u000bThe Joint U.S./Canada contingency plan was invoked and a unified command was formed among the USCG, the City of Detroit, the State of Michigan, and the Canadian Coast Guard.  All activities took place at the MSO Detroit office.\u000bThe active response lasted for only four days.  On the fifth and sixth days, the temperature rose into the 40s and the wind shifted to from the east allowing more of the oil-stained ice to migrate to the shoreline where it could be removed.  The increased temperatures caused an ice jam that flushed all the remaining oiled ice down the Trenton Channel into still frozen Lake Erie.   Only two oiled birds died as a result of the spill.

Berman went aground in the surf zone off Escambron Beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The barge grounded on a hard bottom consisting of rocky substrate with scattered coral after its towing cable parted.\u000b\u000bThe barge had a capacity of three million gallons but was reportedly only half full.  The cargo, a heavy #6 fuel oil, began spilling and impacted nearby shoreline and shallow intertidal habitats immediately.  No estimated leakage rate was available.  Due to strong northerly winds, the surf at the grounding site was quite strong creating a hazardous situation as they pounded the deck of the vessel. \u000b\u000bThe responsible party initially assumed responsibility for the spill, but very quickly expended the ten million dollar limit of their insurance policy.  Full federal funding of the spill occurred at 0600 on January 14 and it became a United States Coast Guard (USCG) directed response.\u000b\u000bThe USCG Gulf Strike Team (GST) was brought onscene and immediately began lightering operations for the barge.  Skimming and lightering operations were effective and removed an estimated 17,700 barrels of oil from the water and leaking barge.  Shoreline cleanup and assessment began almost immediately.  Little progress was made however due to continued leaking of fresh oil from the barge.  Cleaned areas became re-oiled and areas not yet cleaned became more heavily impacted.  Protection strategies were employed for areas at risk that were not yet oiled.  Intensive shoreline cleanup was postponed for the most heavily impacted areas until the sources of re-oiling could be stopped.  Two shallow lagoons near the grounding site were most heavily impacted.  Oil, in the form of large mats, accumulated on the surface and on the bottom of the lagoons.  Submerged oil posed a major cleanup problem during the response.  It was eventually partially removed by divers, vacuum transfer units, and a dredge.  Waste and oily water from dredging operations were collected and separated in a series of swimming pools arranged to decant and filter the effluent from the dredge before returning the filtered water to the sea. \u000b\u000bOn January 15, the barge was refloated, towed to a scuttling site 20 miles northeast of San Juan, and sunk.  This operation was carefully reviewed by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), Navy Superintendent of Salvage (SUPSALV), the GST, and NOAA.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was consulted and on-scene trustee representatives were given an opportunity to discuss the operation and voice their concerns.  It was agreed by all that the sinking of the barge was the best alternative.  Continued re-oiling of the nearshore environment from the unrecoverable oil left onboard was delaying cleanup and preventing resource recovery.  Resource concerns offshore were minimal and it was hoped that the amount of residual oil left on the barge when it sank would be small and have little impact.  Shorelines at risk from any oil released during the scuttling operations were predicted to be on northwestern Puerto Rico, Mona Island, and Hispaniola.\u000b\u000bShoreline cleaning continued in earnest and was more successful with the barge removed.  Surface and buried oil along sand beaches was removed following cleanup guidelines.  Beachrock, riprap, and seawalls were cleaned with pressure washing and chemical cleaners as approved.  Some inaccessible areas were left to clean naturally.  Cleanup guidelines for oiled historical structures were developed and approved by trustees through the Heritage Resource Team.  These structures and resources were then cleaned according to those guidelines.\u000b\u000bOn February 3, oil impacts along northwestern Puerto Rico were reported.  A convergence zone at the northwest corner of the island concentrated debris and oil still being released from the scuttled barge.  Impacts were primarily along 12 miles of shoreline, from Isabella to Borinquen.  This oil was buried as oily sand layers and submerged as oil and sand mats in the protected areas or crenulate bays.  A separate command post was established on the west end of the island and assessments and cleanup operations began immediately.  Crews removed the stranded oil quickly to prevent additional burial.  Cleanup efforts were intensified in this area to minimize risks to nesting sea turtles, whose arrival was imminent. \u000b\u000bAll necessary cleanup guidelines and inspection criteria were in place by mid-February.  With the exception of nearshore reef fish and benthic organisms near the barge's grounding site, there were very few impacts to biological resources.   Seagrasses were oiled near the grounding site.  Very few birds were affected and no substantiated reports of spill related mortalities to reptiles or mammals were received.  The impacted shoreline was divided into 18 shoreline segments or zones.  Most of these zones were cleaned and inspected following the \"how clean is clean\" guidelines, and approved by the FOSC by April 4.  All other zones were signed off by April 25, with the exception of zone 18, which was completed on May 27.  Once approved as clean, each zone entered a monitoring and maintenance phase to address any additional oiling that may occur.  USCG district 7.

The collision occurred while the tug was repositioning on the barge and resulted in an 18-inch crack in the #3 port tank.  The barge was carrying 17,000 barrels of unleaded gasoline and approximately 100 barrels were lost. The crack was above the waterline and was successfully plugged within a few hours of the incident.\u000bWeather onscene was winds from the west at 20 to 25 knots, air temperature 21?F, water temperature 35?F, and one- to two-foot seas.\u000bThe USCG dispatched two boats to survey the incident. An Alco-Sensor test was administered to barge and tug personnel; results were negative.  The USCG established a safety zone between the Whitestone and Throggs Neck bridges.

The failure occurred below the ground near a pipe junction on the east side of Harbor Boulevard just south of Ventura, California.  Approximately 2,000 barrels of a heavy crude produced from a local field, percolated through the ground to the west and underneath the road.  The oil surfaced 50 yards west of Harbor Boulevard and entered a creek,  traveled along this creek approximately 150 yards to the south where it entered McGrath Lake.\u000bMcGrath is a freshwater lake (approximately 800 by 100 yards) situated amongst medium-coarse grained sand dunes and is located 100 to 200 yards inshore of the intertidal zone.  The lake serves as a drainage basin for the surrounding agricultural fields and has no natural communication with the ocean.  To control the lake level, water is routinely pumped out of the lake and into the Pacific Ocean through a pipeline running through the dunes and onto the beach.  When the oil entered the lake, the pump was on and oil was discharged onto the sand beach and into the nearshore environment.  Less than 100 barrels of oil entered the ocean; the majority was contained in the lake, the creek, or was saturated in the sediment.\u000bThe mouth of the Santa Clara river was bermed to prevent oil from entering the estuary.  To control the amount of water flowing through the spill site, water was diverted from the creek to the Santa Clara River via pumps.  Underflow dams and filter fences with sorbent pompoms were installed along the creek.  The vegetated shoreline of the creek and the lake, consisting mostly of tules, was heavily coated with oil.  Because all pumping operations had ceased, the water level in the lake was rising and began covering over already impacted shoreline and affecting more habitat as it rose.  After consulting with the Regional Water Quality Control Board, pumping the lake into the ocean began again and the water level was lowered to where it had been before the spill.  USCG district 11.

The Coast Guard established a 1500 yard evacuation zone around the vessel.  The source of the vapor cloud could be from one or both of two intermodal tanks of 5000 gallons each.  The first contains acetaldehyde oxime (CAS 107-29-9) and the second chloroacetic acid (CAS 79-11-8).  The two intermodal tanks are stacked one on the other, but it is not known which is on top.  Either chemical could have caused the vapor cloud.  At 1025 EST, Charleston Fire Department personnel in level A protection, viewed the deck of the ship from a nearby crane.  No vapor cloud was observed and it appeared that the two tanks were not leaking. Current on-scene wind is from 050 at 3 knots.  Forecast wind is 090 at 10 knots.  NOAA SSC Ed Levine consulted with Louisiana State University, CHEMTREC, and MASS (NOAA Seattle) concerning reactivity of the chemicals.  The consensus is that in proper proportions, the two chemicals could react violently.  The chloroacetic acid is heated during transport (freezing point is 143 degrees F).  Charleston Fire Department personnel are presently on the deck of the vessel.

The cloud seemed to be coming from the deck of the 939-foot container vessel Newark Bay.  The ship carried two 5,000-gallon intermodal tanks; one tank contained acetaldehyde oxime (CAS 107-29-9), the other chloroacetic acid (CAS 79-11-8).  Either chemical could have caused the vapor cloud and, since the tanks were stacked one on top of the other, it was not initially known which was on top.  These chemicals are incompatible and if they had combined in the proper proportions, there could have been a violent reaction.\u000bThe Charleston Fire Department (FD) HAZMAT team performed the initial site survey in Level A protection from a crane that hoisted them over the deck of the ship.   No vapor cloud was visible and neither tank appeared to be leaking.  The FD HAZMAT team later determined that chloroacetic acid was leaking from a faulty valve on the top IMO tank, but no acetaldehyde oxime had been released.  A six-inch hairline crack in the outer insulation skin of the container was also discovered.  The vessel's owners accepted full responsibility for the discharge and hired local cleanup contractors.  The tank owners (Hoyer USA, Inc.) hired a marine surveyor to examine the tank's structural integrity and determine the cause of the failure.\u000bThe on-scene weather was mild, winds one-half to three knots, with afternoon winds forecast to be nine to ten knots.\u000bThe USCG activated the AST and GST.

MSO Tampa closed the port to vessel traffic.  This collision caused three separate emergencies:  1) the Balsa 37,  which was carrying a cargo of phosphate rock, was severely damaged on the starboard side, was listing at an increasing rate, and was in danger of capsizing in the channel; 2) the Ocean 255, which was loaded with jet fuel, gasoline, and a small amount of diesel fuel was burning out of control just south of Mullet Key; and 3) the Bouchard 155  was holed at the port bow spilling approximately 8,000 barrels of #6 fuel oil into Tampa Bay.\u000bStabilizing the vessels was the first priority of responders.  By 2200 the Ocean 255 barge fire was extinguished and the GST was conducting cooling procedures and maintaining a fire watch.  Lightering operations were well underway on the Bouchard 155 barge in preparation for moving it to dockage in the Port of Tampa where it would be cleaned before dry docking.  The Balsa 37 was intentionally grounded outside the shipping channel to prevent it from capsizing and to open the channel for traffic while repairs and stability evaluations were conducted.\u000bAugust 10 overflight observations showed a three- to six-meter wide band of oil along the beaches.  By the next day, this band appeared to be about half its original width.  Systematic shoreline surveys were conducted and oil was found buried by two to eight inches of clean sand deposited during high tide.  Cleanup crews focused on manually removing the band of surface oil high on the beach.  A plan was developed to remove the subsurface oil without generating large volumes of sediment for handling, disposal, and replacement.  The plan called for mechanical removal of the heavy buried layers, manual removal of moderately oiled sediments, and mechanically pushing stained sand onto the lower part of the beach for surf washing.  Pompoms were strung along the surf zone to collect any oil refloated during the surf washing.\u000bBy August 11 the status of the vessels had improved substantially.  The response focus began to change from  emergency issues to skimming operations, protection strategies, forecasts, and planning.\u000bMeanwhile, cleanup crews were contending with very thick oil that had been deposited around some mangrove islands.  Tarmats formed when sediment was mixed with oil along the shallow flats surrounding the islands.  Large thick mats coated mangrove roots, oyster and seagrass beds, and tidal mud flats.  Most of this oil was vacuumed out using vacuum transfer units on grounded barges staged around the islands and shallow areas.  Seawalls within the bay were being washed using high-pressure water heated to 110 degrees.\u000bThe GST was onscene throughout the spill response.  They provided support with the Vessel of Opportunity Skimming System as well as the fire fighting, monitoring, and lightering of the Ocean 255 barge.\u000bRoughly 14.5 miles of fine-grained sand beach from St. Petersburg Beach north to Redington Shores Beach were affected by this spill.  Sand beaches on Egmont Key at the entrance to Tampa Bay were also oiled.  Additionally, four mangrove islands inside the entrance to Boca Ciega Bay at Johns Pass and two small areas of Spartina marsh were oiled.  Jetties, seawalls, and riprap within the bay and at Johns Pass and Blind Pass were also oiled to varying degrees.  It is estimated that over 30 miles of residential seawalls were oiled within Boca Ciega Bay.  Some impact also occurred on the northern side of Mullet Key at Bonne Fortune Key in fringing mangroves.\u000bSeawalls, jetties, walkways, and riprap were cleaned by high-pressure hot-water washes.  PES-51 was considered for some of these cleaning needs, but after observing comparison tests performed by the manufacturer, the RP decided against its use.\u000bCleanup of submerged tarmats offshore is ongoing.  NOAA is working with the  RRT, the GST, the Army Corps of Engineers, the FOSC, State officials, and various scientists and engineers to develop a sound method for dealing with the tarmats.  Additional on-scene participation by NOAA is anticipated.  USCG district 7.

Unburned product was contained in the berm area around the tank farm.  Steuart Petroleum is located in the Jacksonville Port Terminal and the St. Johns River runs within 1,000 feet of it.\u000bThe Jacksonville Fire Department responded to the fire and, in addition to land-side fire-fighting equipment, a fire-fighting boat was stationed on the St. Johns River as a precaution.\u000bThe USCG COTP Jacksonville, closed the channel from the Trout River Inlet through the southern end of the Long Branch range the morning of January 2.  Later that day, the channel was opened to one-way traffic that was restricted to the east side.\u000bThe fire department transferred product from the damaged tank to other tanks and the damaged tank was continuously cooled throughout the operation.  The fire was on top of the tank so the fire fighters blanketed that area with aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) attempting to smother the fire.  To maintain the integrity of the tank, water was continuously pumped into it keeping the level constant.

The platform was not owned by CONOCO; it was considered a \"pirate\" well, probably belonging to a small company.  The wind was out of the southeast at 10 to 12 knots and there were two-foot seas at the time of the report.  At 0830 a Minerals Management Service (MMS) aircraft happened to fly over the area and reported a three-mile slick tending to the northeast.  The contents of the barge, the quantity of fuel on the tug, the product seen in the water, and the source of the leak were unknown.\u000bThe well was owned by South Parish Oil, a bankrupt company, and was thought to be a shut-in well, not a production well.  The report of a collision by a tug with barges was unconfirmed and thought to be erroneous.\u000bOverflights by private aircraft later in the day were unable to locate the source of the spill.  The only beach impact reported was a stretch north of the site estimated from the air to be about 100 feet long and two feet wide with light sheen trailing downwind.  Reports from CONOCO engineers indicated that the oil probably came from a leaky valve and was considered only a minor problem.\u000bA front was moving through the area causing wave action that hid any oil on the surface making acquisition of information from overflights impossible.

The fire initially was burning oil and gas, but the oil fire went out after a short time. Although the fire appears not to be damaging the rig, one person was injured due to burns.  Debra Simecek-Beaty, NOAA, overflew over the spill area (H-65) from 1220 to 1320.  On scene winds were about 15 knots from the NE.  The rig was on fire and a slick extended from the rig to the western end of East Timbalier Island.  The slick contained mostly silver and rainbow sheen with a narrow band of dark colored streamers.  Burn residue was also observed in the slick.  Shoreline impacts on East Timbalier Island extended from the western tip and along the northern shore to the radio tower.  No impacts were observed east of the radio tower.  Two subsequent overflights mapped the shoreline features in greater detail since there had been more than a dozen breaks in the island due to Huricane Andrew.  Winds had increased to greater than 20 knots and a significant sea swell was forming, resulting in 5 -7 foot breakers on the Gulf side of the island.  Although visibility had diminished due to the lower sun angle, it appeared that the amount of oiling in the marshes had decreased significantly.  Only one small pocket of black pooled oil was observed in contrast to yesterday. The oil did not appear from the overflight to have undergone any significant emulsification.  A flight restricted zone with a radius of 5 miles and an altitude of 3000 feet was established around the rig at 1511 for all non- response aircraft.  The zone restriction will last for 6 hours.  The 36 inch boom that was deployed around the rig was destroyed in the fire.  The Coast Guard has deployed two more booms to the west of the rig.  The Coast Guard was unable to deploy the Open Water Containment and Recovery System (OWOCRS) because the water is too shallow.  USCG district 8.

The initial call to report the spill  was to EPA and the NRC where there was some confusion as to whether the  spill was in the inland or coastal zone.  By approximately 1200 on the same day,  MSO Portland was contacted, briefed by the EPA personnel on scene and asked  to take over as the On-Scene Coordinator for a coastal response.  Two MSO  personnel were dispatched.  Situation: It was estimated that 5,000 gallons of the spilled product remained on land and  that 4,000 gallons made it into the Penopscot River about the time of high tide.  The NOAA SSC was contacted as approximately 1300.  It was determined that the threat to aquatic life in the Penopscot River had, for the most part,  subsided, given that the spill had occurred some 12 hours earlier on a falling tide.   It was thought that the chemical would have an acute toxic effect and would  dilute as it moved down the river becoming a diluted, non-toxic solution.  Concern was expressed that the chemical might stay together as a plume for a  distance down river, but that within 12-24 hours the bulk of the product would be  diluted sufficiently.  The MSO was warned to expect a possible localized fish kill  and to be aware of the odor of chlorine down river of the spill (which would  indicate that the product had not completely diluted).

The vessel is headed for Baltimore from Houston with the cargo of Allyl Alcohol's ultimate  destination to be France.  SSC Gary Ott is on scene at MSO Hampton Roads.  The  initial evaluation by NOAA points out that although the material is poisonous,  flammability is the higher risk problem (flash point is 70 degrees Farhenheit), and further evaluations should be conducted with the measure of flammability as  a priority with the toxicity issue considered second in importance to that. The worst case scenario of a very large puddle of the material would have a IDLH  zone of 26 yards due to the low vapor pressure of Allyl Alcohol (17 mmHg at 20  degrees Celsius).

The vessel, Pard I, was near the release working on an underwater pipeline crack for CONOCO.  The weather at the scene was calm, temperature 81?F, winds south-southwest 12 to 13 knots, seas 1 to 2 feet, with visibility 3 miles and decreasing due to fog.\u000bThe incident took place during the early-morning hours, but was not reported until late afternoon.  The lateness of the report was probably caused by reduced visibility because of early-morning fog that restricted the ability of aircraft to spot the spill.  MSO Morgan City reported that CONOCO personnel reported at 1600 that the spill was caused by a break in a CONOCO pipeline and estimated the amount of product spilled at five gallons.  In actuality, the spill, based on initial overflight reports, was probably 300 to 600 gallons.\u000bCONOCO brought in CONOCO response personnel, Clean Gulf, Riedel Peterson, and Petroleum Helicopter, Inc.

USCG pollution investigators identified the tank vessel Yupex, as the source of the spill.  The Yupex is a small Panamanian-flagged tanker owned by a Korean company that provides fuel to fishing fleets.  While taking on fuel at the Pacific Resources Incorporated (PRI) terminal at pier 29, a valve was left partially open allowing diesel being loaded into the tanker's #1 ballast tanks to leak out into the harbor.  The diesel continued to leak as the vessel transited to pier 35 where it docked to take on more cargo.\u000bAn independent marine surveyor gauged the tanks on board the Yupex and found 21,500 gallons less than what the vessel reported to have on board when it left pier 29.   The Yupex had also filed a protest with the PRI terminal indicating that they received 5,000 gallons less diesel than the terminal claims they pumped.  On the basis of this information, the USCG estimated that the volume of diesel spilled was about 25,000 gallons.\u000bCleanup was initiated at 0700 on November 20 by the USCG contractor Pacific Environmental Corporation (PENCO).

The canal drains directly to the Cape Fear River constituting discharge of oil into U.S. waters.  Monitoring wells were placed near the site of the leaching to determine the extent and source of the plume.  Analysis of the groundwater monitoring data revealed a plume of oil that stretched from the site of leaching upslope below a nearby pump pit and below the nearest storage tank (tank 13).\u000b\u000bMSO Wilmington is responding to an oil pollution incident at the City Gas and Transmission Corp., Wilmington, NC, an abandoned oil and waste oil facility.  Oil is leaking at a low rate into a drainage ditch and then into the Cape Fear River. The responsible party has also terminated maintenance of a recovery well located about five feet from the edge of the drainage ditch.  Pumps had been used to remove floating oil from the well while depressing the local ground water level .  This had prevented oil from leaching into the drainage ditch. The facility has approximately 15-20 tanks with concrete bottoms. Some sludges in 55 gallon drums have been observed on the site.

The spill was possibly from bilge pumping.  The identity of the spiller is unknown at this time.  The spilled waste oil is suspected to have been treated with bilge cleaner by the spiller. The spilled oil initially impacted approximately 2 miles of the south bank of the Neches River.  The impact was in pockets along the shoreline and had moderately impacted some marshy areas associated with the small pockets of oil. The salinity of the river water in the vicinity of the spill is estimated at 0.1 ppt (estimate made by MSO Port Arthur).  The  current in the area of the spill is estimated at no more than 0.5 kts. On October 16, MSO Port Arthur FOSC representative, LCDR Ross Tuxhorn was contacted by the NOAA SSC at the request of the CG District 8 Marine Safety Office representative, CDR Wieczynski. At that time the FOSCR stated the problem as noted above and further requested information related to a request by the Texas General Land Office to do an experiment on a designated area of the spill with Oil Spill Eater II (an enzyme product that is advertised as a biological dispersant.  This is one of ten products that have been chosen for testing by NETAC. After consulting with the NOAA Hazmat Biological Assessment Team (Rebecca Hoff), LSU (Charlie Henry), and RPI (Jeff Dahlin), the SSC relayed the information to the FOSC verbally.  The result of the conversation was that the recommendation was that this was not a proper type of oil, or a proper area to experiment with OSE II, and that it was recommended that the experiment not be carried out on this particular spill.  The details of the consultations were put in written form by LSU and RPI and these documents were  FAXed to the FOSC and the RRT-6 members on October 16. On October 17, the FOSCR accomplished a recon of the affected area and decided to change the locations of the areas to be used for an experiment to two drainage outlets that had been affected. these outlets are owned by Dupont.  There is an estimated 15-25 gallons of the waste oil remaining in these two outlets that would be treated with the OSE II. The above change in locations was mentioned at the conference call that took place on October 17 at 1230 CT.  During the call RRT members voiced concerns over the lack of an appropriate monitoring plan, the chemistry of the waste oil, the need to acquire the  approval of the land owner to test on Dupont land, and the lack of a plan to handle the treated product in the event of flooding that would require Dupont to empty the waste oil and product into the Neches River.

The fire apparently broke out in an area where welding equipment was in use.  The  OMNISEA was reported to have 400 pounds of chlorine, 10,000 pounds of ammonia, and 250,000 gallons of diesel onboard.  The ammonia was in the vessel's refrigeration system close to where the fire started.\u000bUnder the Puget Sound Marine Firefighting Response Plan, the Seattle Fire Department became the Marine Firefighting Scene Commander (FFSC).  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) provided technical assistance and established a 250-yard safety zone on the water side of the vessel.  The response was upgraded to a five-alarm fire, and at one time included over 60 pieces of shore-based equipment, 2 Seattle fire boats, and 2 tugs.\u000bThe vessel developed an 8-degree starboard list as a result of the large volume of water continuously being sprayed on her.

A NOAA technical support team reported on-scene to assist the SSC.\u000bThe NOAA support team surveyed the site and collected five water column samples and five shoreline samples for analysis.\u000bNOAA reported that there are many species of birds, fish, snakes, and mammals in the area, as well as alligators.  NOAA recommended that the spartina not be cut.\u000bThe SSC told the FOSC that the pollutants should not spread rapidly because of the location of the barges, the shape of the cut, and the fact that the wind is the primary influence over the localized currents.   NOAA recommended using a bubble curtain if a water-soluble product was released into the water column.  NOAA suggested containing all the product within the far end of the canal in which the barges were located. In addition, four paddle-wheel aerators should be placed diagonally across from each other to generate a circular current within the containment area.  NOAA also recommended damming the cut where the barges were located.  If polychlorinated biphenyls or Aroclor were onboard the barges, as suspected, removing sediments could be necessary in the event of a major release.\u000bThere probably was a spill of around 300 gallons from the Z-62 barge.   According to chemistry analyses from the site, there were at least three different types of oils in the sediment.  The water column was clean.  Samples of the barge's product are being analyzed.  It will not be possible to determine the extent of the spill on the area until the analyses of these samples are completed and compared to the sediment samples.\u000bThe disposal of these barges is an ongoing effort and has been halted due to a lack of funds.

Ten to fifteen minutes after the collision, the Tenyo Maru sank in an estimated 350 feet of water.  The Tenyo Maru, carrying 6,500 barrels of intermediate fuel oil, 2,166 barrels of diesel oil, and some quantity of lube, bilge and fish oils, began leaking oil shortly after it sank.  There were conflicting reports of the weather at the time of the collision, several reports claiming that the weather was clear, while others maintained that it was foggy.\u000bThe incident occurred in Canadian waters very near the Canadian/United States boundary.  The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) implemented the Canadian/U. S. Joint Marine Pollution Contingency Plan.  Since the spill occurred in Canadian waters, the CCG took the lead role in coordinating the spill response.  Ultimately, the majority of shoreline oiling occurred in the United States.  The USCG federalized the U.S. cleanup effort, accessing funding through the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, on July 30 when the owner of the Tenyo Maru discontinued funding the cleanup.\u000bThe Tenyo Maru continued to leak oil after it sank, with the largest amount released shortly after the sinking.  Response to the incident continued into late August.  The bulk of the response effort was scaled down by August 29, as the amount of oil being released from the sunken vessel on a daily basis had reduced significantly.

The USCG Marine Safety Office (MSO) Port Arthur, Texas continued to receive telephone calls about a spill on the canal covering an area as large as 2 miles long and shore-to-shore in the approximately 100-foot wide cut.  USCG investigators from the Marine Safety Detachment (MSD) Lake Charles, Louisiana were unable to verify the spill.  A second investigative team from MSO Port Arthur arrived at the canal near midnight and discovered a yellow and green patchy substance but reported that it did not appear to be oil.  Results of samples forwarded to a local oil company laboratory were confused and did not specifically identify the sample as oil.  Strike team members were called out because of the interest generated by the news stories.

The barge went aground at about 01:30 EDT on October 26th. At this time the barge is not leaking product.  If any of this initial information is incorrect, please let us know ASAP as it would affect any trajectory implications. 1) TRAJECTORY  The forecasted winds will tend to dominate the transport processes and we would expect that the winds will move the product in a southerly direction. If a spill were to occur and persist over a tidal cycle, it is likely that both the inside and outside of northern Pea Island will be threatened.  If the diesel is released, there maybe a toxic shock to bivalves.  The lube oil may coat the eel grass beds on the inside of Pea Island and we would expect a minimal amount of lube oil impacting the sandy beaches on the outer island.  Tomorrow morning, the winds are forecasted from the west and the wind speed will begin to drop off.

A wake from a passing bulk carrier apparently caused the parting of the Jupiter's  transfer hose, grounding cable, and all but one of its mooring lines.  Residual gasoline in the broken transfer hose was believed to have been ignited by a spark on the dock.  The Jupiter's  stern swung around into the Saginaw River and grounded perpendicular to the direction of the river flow.  The grounding resulted in a crack in the vessel's hull from the manifold on the starboard side to 75 feet aft of the manifold on the port side.\u000bArea marinas were evacuated and vessel traffic was halted.  Bangor County Fire Department and USCG personnel arrived on-scene within 30 minutes of the incident.  The pier fire was extinguished in an attempt to save the last mooring line while the fire onboard the vessel remained out of control.  Williams Boots & Coots Company (WB&C) from Houston, Texas, was contracted to fight the fire due to the lack of locally available trained personnel and equipment.  At 1315 on September 17, WB&C personnel extinguished the blaze by applying foam.  Carbon black accumulations falling from the overhead re-ignited the fire at 2300.  This second blaze was cooled with water and extinguished with foam on September 18.  WB&C personnel also applied foam inside the vessel's cargo tanks to prevent re-ignition of the vessel.\u000bRiver flow data were obtained from the Army Corps of Engineers to predict the oil movement.

Two holes were punctured in one of the vessel's cargo tanks, releasing 9458 barrels of heavy crude oil into the water approximately 1.3 miles from Huntington Beach, California.\u000bThe master of the vessel immediately reported the incident to the USCG Marine Safety Office/Group Los Angeles-Long Beach (MSO/Group LA-LB).  The master moved the American Trader into deeper water one mile to the south.  The commanding officer of the MSO/Group assumed the role of the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC).  The responsible parties assumed full financial responsibility for the spill and sent representatives to the Long Beach area.\u000bOil began to come ashore on February 8 in light concentrations around Newport Pier.  By February 9, oil was ashore at Huntington Beach; in some instances, oil in the surf zone here appeared to be in heavier concentrations than observed earlier at Newport Beach. Calm seas and fair weather for most of the response period resulted in a rapid and successful cleanup.  All of the beaches were cleaned by March 2.  The FOSC concluded all cleanup operations by April 3.\u000bThe 22,000 barrels of crude remaining in the damaged cargo tank were lightered by personnel from the USCG Pacific Strike Team and the responsible party using the USCG Air-Deliverable Anti-Pollution Transfer System (ADAPTS).  By 1200 on February 9, the oil from the damaged tank plus 90,000 barrels from the mid-body tanks had been transferred into barges to decrease the draft of the vessel.  Temporary patches were applied to the holes in the hull and the American Trader was moved to an oil transfer facility in Long Beach Harbor to off-load the remaining 470,000 barrels of crude oil.

Exxon personnel notified the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) as well as other involved agencies, and activated the Clean Harbors Cooperative (Coop).  Exxon company volunteers had periodically received practical training on how to deploy boom and other Coop equipment.  This previous training expedited the decision-making process and allowed Exxon to begin response efforts immediately.\u000bInitial response efforts focused on containment of the spill as well as removal of the heaviest concentration of oil.  Environmentally sensitive areas were protected with boom and skimmers that collected the heavier concentrations of free-floating oil.  Since the incident occurred in January, few migratory birds were in the spill area.  Even so, Tri-State Bird Rescue treated over 100 oiled birds that were recovered during the incident.  Cleanup crews in the spill area found over 600 dead birds.\u000bA cleanup committee, consisting of representatives from USCG, Exxon, NOAA, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NY DEC), New Jersey State Department of Environmental Protection (NJ DEP), and New York City Parks and Recreation, monitored cleanup progress until the end of active recovery.

Oil leaked from a severed discharge line near the bottom of one or both of these 54,000-barrel capacity tanks.  It then overflowed the containment dike and moved toward the beach 250 feet away.  VIWAPA personnel constructed sand-based containment trenches and berms along the beach to contain the oil.  They also diverted oil to a diesel storage tank containment area.  Oil began to leak through the trenches, proceeding down the sloping base toward the shoreline.  U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Marine Safety Office (MSO) San Juan personnel flew over the area on September 21 and estimated that approximately 48 barrels of oil had overflowed the trench and entered the harbor, impacting the sand beaches west of the facility.\u000bMSO and USCG Atlantic Area Strike Team (AST) personnel arrived on-scene on September 22.  They immediately began working with VIWAPA and contractor personnel to locate and stop the leak.  The Strike Team lowered the level of oil in the containment areas and secured the leak on September 25. The containment wall had been blown by the wind onto a ten-inch transfer pipe, rupturing the pipe.  An open valve had permitted the oil to escape through the broken pipe.  A total of 14,076 barrels escaped from this tank between September 18 and 25.  Approximately 1,000 barrels overflowed the containment area and entered the water.  Three miles of sand beaches were heavily oiled, with some impacts east of the power plant in the harbor area.  Some of the oil refloated, but local meteorological and oceanographic conditions isolated the resultant secondary impacts to previously oiled beaches.  Response efforts concentrated on the recovery and removal of the oil after it was on the beaches.  No dead fish or animals were reported.  USCG district 7.

NOAA reported that the shoreline is mostly sand beaches, gravel beaches, mixed sand and gravel beaches, and rocky shores or seawalls.  The offshore islands that are surrounded by mangroves would not be affected if the winds continued to be easterly.  NOAA estimated that the slick would tend to the west or northwest and would come ashore on beaches inshore and to the west of the facility.  This could have occurred for a considerable distance, depending on the weather conditions and local small-scale oceanographic circulation patterns.  There was a small chance that, with a large enough quantity of free-floating, unrestricted oil and continued easterly winds, the oil might round Punta Guayanilla and impact the beaches of Punta Verraco and Bahia de Guayanilla.  If this did happen, NOAA advised that the large mangrove forests of Bahia de Guayanilla be protected.  NOAA further advised that the oil would persist in the environment, with a small quantity evaporating during weathering.  Reef impacts would be low because the oil is not very soluble; there would probably be no impacts at all below the surface, although there could be severe shoreline impacts.   In addition, NOAA reported that the oil would strand at the high tide line and persist or wash away, depending on sand and gravel transport on that beach.  Finally, sticky, weathered bunker oil would adhere to rocky shores and mangroves, killing the mangroves when the oil got into the root system. Turtles currently nesting in Puerto Rico and along the sandy beaches of Punta Verraco were at risk.  Oiled adults would suffer irritated mucous membranes and would develop lesions that would probably result in an increased risk of infection.  Oiled hatchlings would probably die, whether they were on the beach or floating offshore.  Oiled turtle eggs and newly hatched turtles had a greater than 80% chance of mortality.  There were many species of birds present, including the brown pelican, a federally listed endangered species.  If oiled feathers remained untreated, the birds would die as a result of loss of insulation or ingestion of oil during preening.  The diving birds (brown pelican, brown booby, terns), wading birds  (herons and egrets), shorebirds (plovers, sandpipers), and ducks were the most likely to be affected because they would dive and wade into the oil slick.  Seabirds (magnificent frigate bird) and gulls skim the surface when feeding and would also be affected.  Large numbers of gulls would also be impacted.

On-site, the NOAA Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC) observed two badly corroded barges lying nearly end-to-end, leaking an unknown oily substance into the waters of the channel.  Some boom had been deployed around portions of the barges and numerous vessels of lengths up to 35 feet, in various stages of maintenance or disrepair surrounded the barge hulls.   Because the barges were unattended and threatened by local high water runoff and local vessel traffic, the SSC recommended immediate efforts to double boom and isolate the barges.  Security measures were suggested to prevent tampering and further damage to the barges until the material within could be properly identified, safely removed and isolated for disposal.  \"Core\" samples from each tank and Level B personnel protection were also strongly recommended.  In addition, the SSC recommended that local and state water board, storm levy and canal lock officials be contacted to ensure immediate emergency response should waters from the spill site and Doullut Canal have to be isolated from the Mississippi River and the sensitive areas of Adams Bay and surrounding wetlands.

The grounding tore a 200-foot gash in the hull of the ship, ruptured 9 of the 23 cargo tanks and released approximately 6,900 barrels of oil into the waters of Rhode Island Sound.  Immediately before the accident, the vessel was observed operating out of the shipping channel, closer to the Brenton Reef than it should have been.  The accident occurred during daylight hours with partly cloudy skies, calm seas, winds NW at 5-10 knots, and visibility 6-8 miles.\u000bThe response began immediately.  Seven rescue ships and several USCG vessels with boom arrived at the scene of the grounding within eleven minutes.  The USCG Atlantic Strike Team (AST) was activated within thirty minutes.  The pre-designated Federal On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) was the Captain of the Port (COTP), Providence, Rhode Island.   The OSC assumed federal responsibility for the spill response within two hours, following the determination that the incident was beyond the control of the ship's captain and the owners, Ballard Shipping of Monrovia, Liberia.  A $50,000 ceiling on the pollution fund was established, which was later raised to $3.4 million.  The OSC immediately hired cleanup contractors and requested boom and other cleanup equipment.  The COTP Providence established a 500 yard safety zone around the grounded vessel.\u000bThe vessel was surrounded with three layers of containment boom.  The remaining cargo onboard was offloaded into barges beginning June 24.  The area within the boom was cleaned with skimmers beginning on June 26.  The booms remained in place until the vessel was cleared by the OSC to sail on July 2.  The T/S World Prodigy arrived at New York Harbor on July 3.  USCG district 1.
