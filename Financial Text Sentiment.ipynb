Several factors have caused cryptocurrencies to slide with potential turbulence ahead with the US presidential election. Still, bitcoin is up over 114% compared to this time last year, begging the question to crypto investors, could it continue to grow or is another crypto winter ahead? Professional Capital Management Founder and CEO Anthony Pompliano joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into why he feels bullish on bitcoin. \"You can think of bitcoin as gold (GC=F) with wings. It gives you that same downside protection, that same kind of purchase power protection. But it also has the asymmetry of an asset that is compounding over that same time period, at about 62% compound annual growth rate for the last ten years.\" says Pompliano  Pompliano elaborates on why bitcoin ETFs have also been popular: \"As we see those financial institutions, those corporations and kind of larger family offices want to allocate to the asset, the ETFs provide a really low cost, liquid way to do that. And so they're going to continue to buy now of course prices go up and down based on buyers and sellers. And so there's more sellers than buyers.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

Markets \"are uncertain\" right now, amid the 2024 presidential election, the future of Fed rate cuts, and recession concerns, \"but we do have a lot of opportunity as well,\" Bruni says. \"There are opportunities across the board.\" Bruni discusses what investors are looking for right now. \"Really people are looking for... what the emerging trends are.\"  Bruni explains the \"weird juxtaposition\" with gold right now. \"In an environment where inflation is falling, gold (GC=F) is making new all time highs.\" They also discuss the Fed and market expectations. \"The market always thinks about things in the way of expectations,\" Bruni notes. \"Pay less attention to... the market expectations and just focus on what the Fed is saying.\" Bruni adds some advice to investors. \"The most important part is just get involved. It's a learning process... be patient and just keep trying... being part of the market is a very important part of building wealth.\" Find more episodes of Stocks in Translation here.

Chris Mancini, Gabelli Funds associate portfolio manager of the Gabelli Gold Fund, joins Catalysts to discuss the precious metal commodity's recent run. Mancini notes that there is growing interest in gold as Wall Street expects interest rates to fall soon, noting, \"we are seeing the economy weaken.\" He highlights that gold-backed ETFs are also gaining traction amid these economic signs of weakness. The Gabelli Gold Fund manages several classes of their gold ETF (GLDIX, GLDCX, GOLDX, GLDAX). \"There has been this consistent solid base load demand from central banks,\" particularly in China, Manchini says. However, the recent rise in gold prices has largely been driven by ETF purchases as interest rates have fallen. When asked about the impact of expected Federal Reserve rate cuts on gold prices, Mancini states, \"If rates continue to decline after this projected next one September, I think that we'll continue to see inflows into the ETFs, and that will drive gold prices higher.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

A single bar of gold — which is about 400 ounces — now costs over $1 million. Bloomberg Intelligence senior macro strategist Mike McGlone sits down with the Market Domination team to talk about gold's price surge in 2024. \"The bottom line for gold is it typically outperforms the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) when it's at a severe discount, which it is now when unemployment rises and the yield curve, which is steeply inverted, disinverts,\" McGlone tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton. \"So all the all the inklings for gold are quite strong upward, particularly if we start getting a little look back and feel in stock market, which would mean somewhat deflationary forces.\" McGlone discusses the scenarios or risk indicators that will mark gold being too stretched as more investors cycle into the commodity space, and how much higher he expects gold to rally to.

Andrew Critchlow, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights' Global Head of News joins Catalysts to share his outlook on gold prices. Critchlow identifies three key factors influencing gold prices: inflation, India's market, and geopolitical risks. He emphasizes that in a high inflationary environment, \"Gold is the ultimate hedge.\" Despite easing inflation in the US, Critchlow notes that pockets of inflation persist both domestically and globally, stating, \"Gold is going to continue to be a hedge to that.\" Regarding India, Critchlow highlights its role as \"a massive consumer of gold globally.\" He explains that India's continued economic growth drives \"the fundamentals of demand for gold prices.\" Lastly, Critchlow discusses geopolitical risks, including elections, trade issues, and global policy changes. He states that gold serves as a safe-haven asset amid this uncertainty. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

While the commodity is up 30% compared to this same time last year, is there more room for gold to grow? Bloomberg Intelligence senior macro strategist Mike McGlone joins Wealth! to give insight into the movements in gold and the commodity market at large. \"Gold is indicating there's bigger problems with the macro economy on a year to date, one year, two year and three year basis. The rock is beating stocks. It's beating the S&amp;P 500 total return. It means something,\" says McGlone. McGlone believes that gold will eventually reach $3,000 per ounce. \"When we have some further back and fill in the stock market, the mantra I've been saying for almost two years now is 'why buy gold with US Treasury T-bills at 5% and the stock market on a tear?' Well, that seems to be shifting in one key indicator is volatility.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!
