Selecting employees from a certain period:

SELECT *
FROM employees
where employees.startdate <= '2008-07-01'
and (employees.enddate >= '2008-07-01'
    OR
    employees.enddate is NULL)
   
   
   
Employee counts by date key:

SELECT  DATE_TRUNC(dates.datekey, 'month') as mt, COUNT(1)
FROM employees cross join dates
where dates.datekey >= employees.startdate 
and (dates.datekey <= employees.enddate
    OR
    employees.enddate is NULL)
group by DATE_TRUNC(dates.datekey, 'month')
order by DATE_TRUNC(dates.datekey, 'month')

Employee count by end of date:

With `d1` as 
(SELECT DISTINCT
    DATE_ADD(DATE_ADD(DATE_TRUNC(dates.datekey, "month"), 1, "month" ), -1, "day") eomonth
FROM dates)

SELECT d1.eomonth, COUNT(1)
from employees cross join `d1` as d1
where d1.eomonth >= employees.startdate
and (d1.eomonth <= employees.enddate
    OR
    employees.enddate is NULL)
group by d1.eomonth
order by d1.eomonth
